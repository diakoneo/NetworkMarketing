	<h1>DEFINITION</h1>

	<p> A business model in which a distributor network is needed to build the
        business. Usually such businesses are also multilevel marketing in nature in that payouts
        occur at more than one level. 

    	</br></br>
        Network marketing is a type of business opportunity that is very popular with people looking for part-time, flexible businesses. Some of the best-known companies in America, including Avon, Mary Kay Cosmetics, Rain International and Tupperware, fall under the network marketing umbrella.

        </br></br>
        Network marketing programs feature a low upfront investment-usually only a few hundred
        dollars for the purchase of a product sample kit-and the opportunity to sell a product line
        directly to friend, family and other personal contacts. Most network marketing programs also ask
        participants to recruit other sales representatives. The recruits constitute a reps downline, and
        their sales generate income for those above them in the program.

 		</br></br>
        Things can get sticky when a network marketing network compensates participants primarily for
        recruiting others rather than for selling the companys products or services. A network marketing
        system in which most of the revenue comes from recruitment may be considered an illegal
        pyramid scheme.

        </br></br>
        Since network marketing programs are usually exempt from business opportunity regulation and
        arent defined as franchises under state and federal franchise laws, youll need to do your own
        investigation before investing any money.</p>
