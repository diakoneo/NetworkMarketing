    <h1>Direct Marketing</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Reviewed by Will Kenton </p>
    
    <ul><li>What Is Direct Marketing?</li></ul>
    <p>Direct marketing is an advertising strategy that relies on the individual distribution of a sales pitch to potential customers. Mail, email, and texting are among the delivery systems used. It is called direct marketing because it generally eliminates the middleman such as advertising media.</p>

    <ul><li>How Direct Marketing Works</li></ul>
    <p>Unlike most marketing campaigns, direct marketing campaigns do not rely on advertising in mass media. Instead, they deliver their sales pitches by mail, by phone, or by email. Although the numbers of pitches sent can be massive, an attempt is often made to personalize the message, inserting the recipient's name or city in a prominent place. 
    </br></br>

    The call to action is a common factor in much of direct marketing. The recipient of the message is urged to immediately respond by calling a toll-free phone number, sending in a reply card, or clicking on a link in an email promotion. Any response is a positive indicator of a prospective purchase. This variety of direct marketing is often called direct response marketing. </p>

    <ul><li>Targeting in Direct Marketing</li></ul>
    <p>The most effective direct marketing campaigns use lists of targeted prospects in order to send their messages only to the likeliest prospects. The lists might target families who have recently had a baby, or new homeowners, or recent retirees with products or services that they are most likely to need.
    </br></br>
    Catalogs are a form of direct marketing with a history that dates back to the latter half of the 19th century. In modern times, catalogs are usually sent only to consumers who have indicated an interest by a previous purchase of a similar product.</p>

    <ul><li>The Advantages and Disadvantages of Direct Marketing</li></ul>
    <p>A direct marketing pitch that is delivered to the widest possible audience is probably the least effective. That is, the company may gain a few customers while merely annoying all of the other recipients. Junk mail, spam email, and texting all are forms of direct marketing that many people can't get rid of fast enough. 
    </br></br>

    Many companies engage in opt-in or permission marketing, which limits their mailing or emailing to people who have indicated a willingness to receive it. Lists of opt-in subscribers are particularly valuable as they indicate a real interest in the products or services being advertised.</p>

    <ul><li>Who Uses Direct Marketing</li></ul>
    <p>Despite its drawbacks, direct marketing has its appeal, particularly to companies on a shoestring budget who can't afford to pay for television or internet advertising campaigns.
    </br></br>
    Direct marketing is the preferred advertising strategy for small local businesses, which can distribute hundreds of fliers, coupons, or menus for less than it would cost them to place an ad or make a commercial. 
    </br></br>
    By its nature, the effectiveness of a direct marketing campaign is easier to measure than other types of advertising. This is because they often contain a call to action. The company and measure its success by how many consumers make the call, return the card, use the coupon, or click on the link.</p>

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul><li>Direct marketing relies on distribution to individual consumers rather than advertising in mass media.</li>

    <ul><li>Direct marketing fundamentals</li></ul>
    <p>Direct marketing occurs when the “producer” connects with the end user. The end user may be a consumer or a business.
    </br></br>
    Direct marketing applies to product and service-oriented businesses, and to nonprofit organizations. In all situations, there is no intermediary involved. Direct marketing describes this interactive communication with the end user.
    </br></br>
    Direct marketing is not synonymous with mass marketing. The most effective direct marketing takes place when there is a clear connection to reach the target market.
    </br></br>
    Organizations may use several ways to leverage direct marketing as they communicate with and deliver products to their customers. This may include using a direct sales force, catalogs, websites, email, direct mail, telemarketing, seminars, trade shows, and other ―one-to-one‖ techniques to communicate and sell to their customers and clients.
    </br></br>
    Some of these direct marketing methods have grown dramatically, especially with the growth of marketing over the Internet. There is evidence that other direct marketing approaches have diminished, such as reports that the response to direct mail is often below one percent compared to the five percent+ response rate numbers more commonly experienced in the past.</p>

        <h2><strong>Types of Direct Marketing</strong></h2>
        <p>The most common forms of direct marketing are:</p>
        <ul><li>Internet marketing</li>
        <li>Face-to-face selling</li>
        <li>Direct mail</li></ul>
        <li>Catalogs</li>
        <li>Telemarketing</li></ul>
        <li>Direct-response advertising</li>
        <li>Kiosk marketing</li></ul>

        
    </div>
    
        <p>Let‘s look at these in more detail:</p>
        <ul><li>Internet Marketing</li></ul>
        <p>The Internet has revolutionized direct marketing for promoting the sale of products and services to targeted audiences. Access to the Internet provides users with services in four basic areas:<br>
            i. Information<br>
            ii. Entertainment<br>
            iii. Shopping<br>
            iv. Individual and group communication<br><br>

        Online channels can eliminate geographic considerations. With this capability people around the world have the same access as the person across the street. Many businesses that can sell their products and services through downloading, or who can economically ship those products, have discovered an entirely new way to market. 
        <br><br>
        The Internet makes direct marketing easier, more targeted, more flexible, more responsive, more affordable, and potentially more profitable than ever. Virtually every business should seriously consider the Internet as a part of their marketing mix and determine if it is a viable fit for their direct marketing efforts.

        </p>

        <ul><li>Face-to-Face Selling</li></ul>
        <p> 
            The most traditional direct marketing involves the in-house sales force personally contacting potential and established consumers. Examples of organizations that use face-to-face selling include:<br>
            i. Mary Kay<br>
            ii. Avon<br>
            iii. Amway<br>
        </p>

        <ul><li>Direct Mail</li></ul>
        <p>Direct mail is described as sending information about a special offer, product or sale announcement, service reminder, or some other type of communication to a person at a particular street or electronic address. Historically direct mail has existed in the form of printed materials, but CDs, audio tapes, video tapes, fax mail, email, and voice mail are also used in direct mail campaigns. For example, America Online experienced a highly successful campaign through mailing out CD-ROMs to prospective customers. Direct mail permits high target-market selectivity; it can be personalized, it is flexible, and it allows early testing and response measurement to take place. A highly selective and accurate mailing list often determines the success of direct mail efforts to enhance response rates and control costs.</p>

        <ul><li>Catalogs</li></ul>
        <p>Product catalogs are another version of direct mail where the catalogs are the communication tool. The most common use of this approach involves featuring a variety of products that target the needs of a specific audience who have shown a propensity to order from catalogs. An increasing number of business-to-business marketers are sending catalogs on CD-ROM to prospects and customers. The average U.S. household receives more than 50 catalogs each year, ranging from general merchandise to specialty goods.<br>
        Examples of general merchandise catalogs are:<br>
        i. Spiegel<br>
        ii. J.C. Penny<br><br>

        Examples of specialty goods catalogs are:<br>
        i. Pottery Barn<br>
        ii. PC Connection</p>

        <ul><li>Telemarketing</li></ul>
        <p>The process of contacting people on a qualified list to sell services over the phone has grown in popularity to the point that the average household receives 19 telemarketing calls each year. Successful telemarketing campaigns depend on a good calling list, an effective script and contact structure, and well-trained people that are compensated and rewarded for making calls that result in sales. The telecommunications industry, for example, has used telemarketing extensively to attempt to increase their market share.<br>
        This includes:<br>
        i. AT&T<br>
        ii. MCI WorldCom<br>
        iii. Sprint</p>

        <ul><li>Direct-Response Advertising</li></ul>
        <p>Direct-response advertising is communicating with potential buyers through television, radio, magazines, and newspapers. The prospective consumer watches, hears, or reads about the product or service and initiates a call to a toll-free number to place their order. Television, for example, offers a wide range of exposure, from a 30-second commercial to a 60-minute infomercial.</p>

        <ul><li>Kiosk Marketing</li></ul>
        <p>Customer order machines, versus vending machines that actually provide products, are another form of direct marketing. Examples are:<br>
        i. Eddie Bauer: Stores place computer terminals to order from the entire line of products not available in the retail store.<br>
        ii. Florsheim Shoe Company Your bank‘s automatic teller machines (ATMs) placed in convenient and high traffic areas are another example of kiosk marketing. A combination of these direct marketing techniques may offer the optimal revenue generating solution.</p>

        <ul><li></li></ul>
