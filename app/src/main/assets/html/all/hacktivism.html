	<h1>Hacktivism</h1>
    <p>Hacktivism is the use of (illegal) hacking techniques for an activist cause. Hacktivism could be further defined as "the non-violent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of political ends". These tools include web site defacements, redirects, denial-of-service attacks, information theft, virtual sit-ins, and virtual sabotage. Like any form of activism, doing something for (what you consider to be) a good cause does not make it legal or right.</p>

    <h2>Viruses & Worms</h2>
    <p>The best-known types of malware, viruses and worms, are known for the manner in which they spread, rather than any other particular behavior. The term computer virus is used for a program that has infected some executable software and, when run, causes the virus to spread to other executable.
    <br><br>
    Viruses may also perform other actions, like creating a backdoor for later use, damaging files, or even damaging equipment. On the other hand, a worm is a program that actively transmits itself over a network to infect other computers. Worms may also take malicious actions.
    <br><br>
    These definitions lead to the observation that a virus requires user intervention to spread, whereas a worm spreads itself automatically. Using this distinction, infections transmitted by email or Microsoft Word documents, which rely on the recipient opening a file or email to infect the system, would be classified as viruses rather than worms.</p>

    <h2>Trojans</h2>
    <p>In broad terms, a Trojan horse is any program that invites the user to run it, concealing a harmful or malicious payload. The payload may take effect immediately and can lead to many undesirable effects, such as deleting the user's files or further installing malicious or undesirable software. Trojan horses known as droppers are used to start off a worm outbreak, by "injecting" the worm into users' local networks.
    <br><br>
    One of the most common ways that spyware is distributed is as a Trojan horse, bundled with a piece of desirable software that the user downloads from the Internet. When the user installs the software, the spyware is installed alongside. Spyware authors who attempt to act in a legal fashion may include an end-user license agreement that states the behavior of the spyware in loose terms, which the users are unlikely to read or understand.</p>

    <h2>Rootkits</h2>
    <p>Originally, a rootkit was a set of tools installed by a human attacker on a UNIX system, allowing the attacker to gain administrator (root) access. Today, the term rootkit is used more generally for concealment routines in a malicious program. Once a malicious program is installed on a system, it is essential that it stays concealed, to avoid detection and disinfection. The same is true when a human attacker breaks into a computer directly. Techniques known as rootkits allow this concealment, by modifying the host's operating system so that the malware is hidden from the user. Rootkits can prevent a malicious process from being visible in the system's list of processes, or keep its files from being read.
    <br><br>
    In an attempt to keep the user from stopping a malicious process, another is sometimes installed to monitor it. When the process is stopped (killed), another is immediately created. Modern malware starts a number of processes that monitor and restore one another as needed. In the event that a user running Microsoft Windows is infected with such malware (if they wish to manually stop it), they could use Task Manager's 'processes' tab to find the main process (the one that spawned the "resurrector process (es)"), and use the 'end process tree' function, which would kill not only the main process, but the "resurrector(s)" as well, since they were started by the main process. Some malware programs use other techniques, such as naming the infected file similar to a legitimate or trustworthy file (expl0rer.exe VS explorer.exe) to avoid detection in the process list.</p>

    <h2>Backdoors</h2>
    <p>A backdoor is a method of bypassing normal authentication procedures. Once a system has been compromised (by one of the above methods, or in some other way), one or more backdoors may be installed in order to allow easier access in the future. Backdoors may also be installed prior to malicious software, to allow attackers entry</p>

    <h2>Spyware</h2>
    <p>Spyware is a type of malicious software that can be installed on computers, and which collects small pieces of information about users without their knowledge. The presence of spyware is typically hidden from the user, and can be difficult to detect. Typically, spyware is secretly installed on the user's personal computer. While the term spyware suggests software that secretly monitors the user's computing, the functions of spyware extend well beyond simple monitoring. Spyware programs can collect various types of personal information, such as Internet surfing habits and sites that have been visited, but can also interfere with user control of the computer in other ways, such as installing additional software and redirecting Web browser activity. Spyware is known to change computer settings, resulting in slow connection speeds, different home pages, and/or loss of Internet connection or functionality of other programs. In an attempt to increase the understanding of spyware, a more formal classification of its included software types is provided by the term privacy-invasive software.
    <br><br>
    Classification of code as spyware (or sometimes browser cookies as "tracking" cookies) can be controversial. Often the software is installed by the user knowing that some amount of monitoring will take place. Users generally agree to this activity to get free software and it is often associated with music and video sharing. Some such software allows the user to turn off the monitoring, assuming they are aware of it and can find instructions for disabling it. Anti-spyware is usually part of anti-virus programs; scan using at least two different AV packages. Spybot Search and Destroy is a good freeware program for looking for spyware.</p>

    <h2>Loggers</h2>
    <p>Keystroke logging (often called key logging) is the action of tracking (or logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically in a covert manner so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. There are numerous key logging methods, ranging from hardware and software-based approaches to electromagnetic and acoustic analysis. Key logging is often used by law enforcement, parents, and jealous or suspicious spouses (lovers). The most common use, however, is in the workplace, where your employer is monitoring your use of the computer. Unfortunately, all of these activities are legal.</p>

    <h2>Adware</h2>
    <p>Adware, or advertising-supported software, is any software package which automatically plays, displays, or downloads advertisements to a computer. These advertisements can be in the form of a pop-up. The object of the Adware is to generate revenue for its author. Adware, by itself, is harmless; however, some adware may come with integrated spyware such as key loggers and other privacy-invasive software.
    <br><br>
    Advertising functions are integrated into or bundled with the software, which is often designed to note what Internet sites the user visits and to present advertising pertinent to the types of goods or services featured there - making it related to spyware.
    <br><br>
    Adware is usually seen by the developer as a way to recover development costs, and in some cases it may allow the software to be provided to the user free of charge or at a reduced price. The income derived from presenting advertisements to the user may allow or motivate the developer to continue to develop, maintain and upgrade the software product. Conversely, the advertisements may be seen by the user as interruptions or annoyances or as distractions from the task at hand.
    <br><br>
    Some adware is also shareware, and so the word may be used as a term of distinction to differentiate between types of shareware software. What differentiates adware from other shareware is that it is primarily advertising-supported, like many free Smartphone apps. Users may also be given the option to pay for a "registered" or "licensed" copy to do away with the advertisements. Radio offers both a free version (with ads) and a paid subscription (without ads).
    <br><br>
    There is a group of software (Alexa toolbar, Google toolbar, Eclipse data usage collector, etc.) that sends data to a central server about which pages have been visited or which features of the software have been used. However they differ from "classic" malware because these tools only send data with the user's approval. The user may opt in to share the data in exchange for additional features and services or (in case of Eclipse) as a form of voluntary support for the project.
    <br><br>
    Some security tools report such loggers as malware while others do not. The status of this group is questionable.
    <br><br>
    Some tools like PDF Creator are more on the boundary than others because opting out has been made more complex than it could be (during the installation, the user needs to uncheck two check boxes rather than one). However, PDF Creator is only sometimes mentioned as malware and is still subject of discussions.</p>

    <h2>Security & Administration</h2>
    <p>It seems appropriate after discussing malware to talk about protecting your system and keeping it running well. In the workplace, the IT department will handle this - of course, in a small business, you may be the IT department. For hand-held devices, you generally don't have access to all the tools discussed here. However, much of this applies as much to Smartphone as to your desktop PC or laptop. For these devices, you are the system administrator.</p>

    <h2>What if you have a Mac?</h2>
    <p>It may surprise those in the Windows world to hear it, but there is disagreement about whether it is worth it to worry about malware in the Mac world. In fact, most malware has been generated for the far more popular Windows world. And, the lack of control over applications for Windows has encouraged this (and the many more applications than are available for Macs). Some also think there are inherently fewer bugs (vulnerabilities) to exploit in the Mac. However, currently there is a great deal of news being generated by malware written for the Mac. (I believe Firewalls, anti-virus and anti-spyware should be used on all computer systems, including your Smartphone.) As malware and general PC administration is the focus here, we will revisit some of these issues later for more specific topics, like networks and the Internet.</p>
