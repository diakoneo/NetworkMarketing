    <h1>How to Access the Dark Web: Browsing Dark Web, TOR Browser, and .Onion Websites by: Timothy Shim</h1>
    <p>The World Wide Web, much like real life, is so massive that it would take you a lifetime to traverse every nook and cranny. To compound that fact, by the time you were halfway done, so much more content would have been created and updated that you‘d have to start all over again.
        <br><br>
    All of this is well known, but how many of you are aware that the content you usually encounter on the web is barely the tip of a massive iceberg of information?</p>

    <h2>Imagine a real iceberg</h2>
    <p>The top protrudes above the water and is visible, yet the real bulk of the iceberg is below that, unseen. The World Wide Web is similar, in which the regular sites we visit are the top of that iceberg. This includes common sites such as Wikipedia, Google and even the millions of blogs that come and go daily.<br><br>
    Beneath the water lurks the deep and dark, hidden from view for various reasons, the Dark Web. Less nefarious is the information that skims the surface of the Dark Web, in a zone called the Deep Web. Those belong to large corporates or governments and are never exposed to the public, such as medical records, government reports, and financial records and such. These are kept away from search engines and behind powerful firewalls to protect them.
    <br><br>
    It‘s truly in the depths of the of the dark web that things get shady – and oftentimes dangerous.</p>
    <img src="img/hp_img_thirty nine.jpg">
    <h2>The web is much more than meets the eye, there’s tons of it that is hidden</h2>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Why is the Dark Web hidden?</h2>
    <p>In the case of the deep web, since personal records, government documents and such are not meant for public view in the first place, those are understandably kept safe. However, they still are mostly connected to the Internet since much of that information forms an ecosystem for many surface web applications.
    <br><br>
    The Dark Web is slightly more complicated. This part of the World Wide Web is often run on networks of private servers, allowing communication only via specific means. This enables a high degree of anonymity and makes it difficult for authorities to shut down. Unfortunately, this has led to Dark Web to become a place where many illegal activities take place. </p>

    <h2>What’s hidden in the Dark Web?</h2>
    <p>If you‘ve ever heard of cybercrime, you‘ll probably know that the cybercriminals of today are after more than just money. They take literally anything of value, which means credit card information, personal information and more. All of these things are commodities on the Dark Web, to be bought, sold or traded.
    <br><br>
    Aside from that, there are also business dealings that are illegal and can‘t be conducted on the surface web. Almost anything can be bought on the Dark Web – for a price. The items available can include firearms, illegal drugs, illegal wildlife, or even the rental of a hitman! Finally, there is the most depraved and undesirable of all – those who deal in the sickest and most perverse types of pornography, which is illegal, is almost every part of the world. Even the advertising you‘ll see while browsing the Dark Web will be different. Here you might even find Guns R Us!</p>

    <h2>How to Access Dark Web Websites</h2>
    <p><strong>Warning!<br>
    Before proceeding further, it is important that you understand that many things on the Dark Web are highly illegal. No matter what precautions you take, being able to stay anonymous is highly unlikely. Enter at your own risk!</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Download and install the TOR browser</h2>
    <img src="img/hp_img_fourty.jpg">
    <p>Despite its current usage as a browser that is often used to access parts of the Dark Web, TOR (aka. the dark web browser) was originally developed to help safeguard U.S. Intelligence online communication.<br><br>
    Today, it is one of the few ways to access .onion websites, which are located on the Dark Web.<br><br>
    TOR is a version of the popular Firefox web browser, modified to allow users to browse the web anonymously. The browser is designed to block or advise against user attempts to do things that might reveal their identity, such as resizing the dimensions of the browser window, for example. While you‘re waiting for TOR to download, take the time to stick a piece of dark tape over your webcam lens. You never know what might happen.<br><br>
    And also – check out the following introduction video by TOR.
    <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">?</span></p>

    <h2>2. Consider paying for a Virtual Private Network service</h2>
    <p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are servers that you connect through to access the web. These servers help to mask your origin and may emulate locations from many other places in the world. Although TOR masks your identity, it does not hide your location.<br><br>

    For those who have not used a VPN service before, you might like to try out how it works before paying for one. Kaspersky has a free version that allows 200MB of data usage per month. If you don‘t mind paying, ExpressVPN and NordVPN exceed most other paid VPN services in my opinion.</p>

    <h2>3. DuckDuckGo is your friend</h2>
    <p>Navigating the Dark Web is slightly different. Remember the phase that often tossed about: ‗Google is your friend’? Well, Google doesn’t index sites on the Dark Web, so there; your best friend will be DuckDuckGo, which does a similar job.
        <img src="img/hp_img_fourty one.jpg"></p>

    <h2>4. Sign up for a secure email address</h2>
    <p>Now that you‘re ready to go, it‘s time to sign up for an untraceable email address. Gmail is out of the question, and you‘ll need an email address to register for many .onion websites.<br><br>
Here are a few that you might like to consider:<br>
 ProtonMail<br>
 TORbox<br>
 Mail2Tor<br>
Note that these come with .onion domains as well, which you need to access using the TOR browser. Regular browsers like Chrome and Firefox will not work.</p>

<h2>5. Dark web search engine</h2>
<p>onion is a domain exclusively used on the Dark Web. These are similar to regular domains, but cannot be accessed without a specialized browser like TOR. Here are a couple of relatively harmless .onion addresses that you can try out:<br>
 DuckDuckGo Search Engine<br>
 eBooks<br><br>
There are huge lists of .onion websites available and it only takes a little effort to find them. Again, bear in mind that you may bump into strange (and again, highly illegal) things on the Dark Web.<br>

    <h2>How safe is it to play in the Dark Web?</h2>
    <p>It sounds exotic and there is that thrill of the unknown and unexplored, but much likes the deep blue sea, many dangers are hidden. As the average run of-the-mill Joe (or Jill, as the case may be), how safe is it to explore the dark web?<br><br>
    Although there are truly exotic things on the dark web that you would not normally see, along with even some of the more mundane albeit in anonymous form (for you), the dark web isn‘t a place for you to blindly stumble about.<br><br>
    There are very bad things and people around that running into could result in serious consequences for you. This applies not only to bad guys, but there is also a very real chance of problems with law enforcement, depending on what you do.<br><br>
    In case you‘re not convinced, here are some examples of what goes on in the dark web and the consequences;</p>

    <h2>Drug Distribution</h2>
    <p> Earlier this year, a couple in the US was charged for selling drugs under the dark web vendor handle of MH4Life on various trade sites. They were using the dark web to sell Fentanyl, a type of opioid which is frequently abused as a recreational drug as well as other illicit substances. The pair was arrested despite using cryptocurrency, virtual private networks and proxies as well as other elaborate distraction techniques.</p>

    <h2>Guns, Gold and Cash</h2>
    <p>More than 35 people in New York and California were arrested by a combined-agency task force for selling contraband on the dark web. Among items seized were more than 100 guns, $3.6 million in cash and 2,000 Bitcoins.<br>
    
    <h2>Kidnapping & Sex Trafficking</h2>
    <p>A Polish man was planning to sell a kidnapped British model on the dark web. When plans went awry, he was arrested in Italy where his victim claimed that he boasted of earning more than $17 million selling kidnapped women on the dark web.</p>
