	<h1>Malware</h1>
    <p>Malware, short for malicious software, consists of programming (code, scripts, active content, and other software) designed to damage or disable the system or data, disrupt or deny operation, gather information that leads to loss of privacy or exploitation, gain unauthorized access to system resources, and other abusive behavior. The expression is a general term used by computer professionals to mean a variety of forms of hostile, intrusive, or annoying software or program code.
    <br><br>
    Malware is not the same as defective software - software that has a legitimate purpose but contains harmful bugs or programming errors. Since the result may be the same, it should be clear that intent is considered important although this is a historically vague rule.</p>

    <h2>What Is Its Purpose?</h2>
    <p>Categorizing malware by its purpose - the intent of the author - can be difficult or impossible. The following categories just give us a way to think about malware. Others might choose different categories, place a particular piece of malware in a different category, and some malware might reasonably fit into multiple categories.</p>

    <h2>Pranks</h2>
    <p>Many early infectious programs, including a number of MS-DOS viruses, were written as experiments or pranks. They were generally intended to be harmless or merely annoying, rather than to cause serious damage to computer systems. In some cases, the perpetrator did not realize how much harm his or her creations would do. Young programmers learning about viruses and their techniques wrote them simply for practice, or to see how far they could spread. As late as 1999, widespread viruses such as the Melissa virus appear to have been written chiefly as a prank. Many believe the infamous Morris Worm, that shut down a large part of the Internet in 1988 and started a new era in network security, was a prank or experiment gone wrong - others are not so sure it belongs in this category. In any case, none of these efforts had any "legitimate purpose" for you, the user/manager/owner of the system "attacked".</p>

    <h2>Intentionally Harmful</h2>
    <p>Hostile intent related to vandalism can be found in programs designed to cause harm or data loss. Many DOS viruses, and the Windows Explore Zipworm, were designed to destroy files on a hard disk, or to corrupt the file system by writing invalid data to them. Network-born worms, such as the 2001 Code Redworm, fall into the same category. Sometimes a worm is designed to vandalize web pages, like the online equivalent to graffiti tagging, with the author's alias or affinity group appearing everywhere the worm goes. (Note that the basic purpose of most web pages is to provide information, to communicate, so interfering with that goal is generally harmful.)</p>

    <h2>Profit</h2>
    <p>Since the rise of widespread broadband Internet access, some malicious software has been designed for a profit, like forced advertising, for example. (Some forced advertising causes your browser to redirect you to an advertising page or displays pop-ups.) Since 2003, the majority of widespread viruses and worms have been designed to take control of users' computers for black-market exploitation. Infected "zombie computers" are used to send email spam, to host contraband data such as child pornography, or to engage in distributed denial-of-service attacks as a form of extortion.
    <br><br>
    The latest versions seems to be claiming that you have a virus and "offering" you a solution or claiming that you have violated a law and need to send money (by credit card) to avoid prosecution. (The latter is often related to pornography and usually occurs when you are visiting such a site, which hints at an avoidance strategy.) In the worst case, your data is encrypted and held hostage until you pay (Ransom ware).
    <br><br>
    In each case, your best bet is to not click on anything on the web page or any pop-ups. Instead, start your task manager or system monitor and delete or kill the process. Sort the processes by name; find every instance of your browser application and "force stop" them all. If necessary, reboot your computer. If necessary use a "hard reboot" - hold the power button in for ten seconds. If none of those are successful, it's time to contact your IT department. The sidebar explaining process appeared in the last module.</p>

    <h2>Indirect Profit</h2>
    <p>Another strictly for-profit category of malware has emerged in spyware - programs designed to monitor users' web browsing or other activity, display unsolicited advertisements, or redirect affiliate marketing revenues to the spyware creator. Spyware programs do not generally spread like viruses; they are, in general, installed by exploiting security holes or are packaged with user-installed software, such as peer-to-peer music sharing applications. Sometimes, the spyware is loaded unknowingly by the user in response to a web page pop-up. Probably the easiest step you can take to minimize attacks of all sorts is to use a "non-privileged" user account on a day-to-day basis.</p>
