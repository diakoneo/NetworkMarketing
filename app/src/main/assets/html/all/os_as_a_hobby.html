	<h1>Operating System Development as a Hobby.</h1>
    <p>Operating system development is one of the most complicated activities in which a computing hobbyist may engage. A hobby operating system may be classified as one whose code has not been directly derived from an existing operating system, and has few users and active.
    <br><br>
    In some cases, hobby development is in support of a "homebrew" computing device, for example, a simple single-board computer powered by a 6502 microprocessor. Or, development may be for architecture already in widespread use. Operating system development may come from entirely new concepts, or may commence by modeling an existing operating system. In either case, the hobbyist is his/her own developer, or may interact with a small and sometimes unstructured group of individuals who have like interests.</p>

    <h2>Examples Of A Hobby Operating System Include Syllable.</h2>
    <ul><li>Diversity Of Operating Systems And Portability</li></ul>
    <p>Application software is generally written for use on a specific operating system, and sometimes even for specific hardware. When porting the application to run on another OS, the functionality required by that application may be implemented differently by that OS (the names of functions, meaning of arguments, etc.) requiring the application to be adapted, changed, or otherwise maintained.
    <br><br>
    UNIX was the first operating system not written in assembly language, making it very portable to systems different from its native PDP-11.
    <br><br>
    This cost in supporting operating systems diversity can be avoided by instead writing applications against software platforms like Java or Qt. These abstractions have already borne the cost of adaptation to specific operating systems and their libraries. Another approach is for operating system vendors to adopt standards. For example, POSIX and OS abstraction layers provide commonalities that reduce porting costs.</p>

    <p>In 2014, Android was first (currently not replicated by others, in a single year) operating system ever to ship on a billion devices, becoming the most popular operating system by installed base.</p>

    <h2>Comparison of Operating Systems.</h2>
    <p>These tables provide a comparison of operating systems, of computer devices, as listing general and technical information for a number of widely used and currently available PC or handheld (including Smartphone and tablet computer) operating systems. The article "Usage share of operating systems" provides a broader, and more general, comparison of operating systems that includes servers, mainframes and supercomputers.
    <br><br>
    Because of the large number and variety of available Linux distributions, they are all grouped under a single entry; see comparison of Linux distributions for a detailed comparison. There is also a variety of BSD and DOS operating systems, covered in comparison of BSD operating systems and comparison of DOS operating systems.
    <br><br>
    For information on views of each operating system, see operating system advocacy.</p>

    <h2>Embedded operating system</h2>
    <p>While the distinction is mostly import to technophiles, hand-held devices (including early Smartphone) use (d) a class of operating system that is called "embedded". (Of embedded.) Embedded systems, on the other hand, is a term generally used to refer to (usually real-time) systems with limited functionality. Embedded systems are quite common. They are in many devices, such as cars, microwave ovens, printers, etc. Embedded-OS devices are becoming much more common.</p>

    <h2>User Interface</h2>
    <p>From a user perspective, the user interface (typically a GUI) is the operating system. Actually this is just the way you, the user, can talk directly to the OS to accomplish system level tasks. As noted above, Microsoft considers the user interface to be a part of the OS, while some others, notably Linux, allow you to choose (and change) the interface. In the workplace, you typically will not have a choice because IT departments like to keep to one kind of system.
    <br><br>
    The video at right follows the progression of Microsoft desktop interfaces from DOS, a command line interface, to some guesses about Windows 7. (It was recorded before the release).</p>

    <h2>System Utilities</h2>
    <p>Utility software is a kind of system software designed to help analyze, configure, optimize and maintain the computer. A single piece of utility software is usually called a utility or tool.
    <br><br>
    Utility software should be contrasted with application software, which allows users to do things like creating text documents, playing games, listening to music or surfing the web. Rather than providing these kinds of user-oriented or output-oriented functionality, utility software usually focuses on how the computer infrastructure (including the computer hardware, operating system and application software and data storage) operates. Due to this focus, some utilities are rather technical and targeted at people with an advanced level of computer knowledge. Others are commonly used by all users - a task manager is shown on the right.
    <br><br>
    Most utilities are highly specialized and designed to perform only a single task or a small range of tasks. However, there are also some utility suites that combine several features in one piece of software. Most major operating systems come with several pre-installed utilities. You may have to (find and) add utilities for your Smartphone, though. Although utilities are part of the system software, they are not part of the OS per se. They are loaded into memory as needed, either by the user or the OS.
