    <h1>Power Supply</h1>
    <h2>Definition - What does Power Supply mean?</h2>
    <p>A power supply is a component that supplies power to at least one electric load. Typically, it converts one type of electrical power to another, but it may also convert different form of energy â€“ such as solar, mechanical, or chemical - into electrical energy.
    <br><br>
    A power supply provides components with electric power. The term usually pertains to devices integrated within the component being powered.
    <br><br>
    For example, computer power supplies convert AC current to DC current and are generally located at the rear of the computer case, along with at least one fan. A power supply is also known as a power supply unit, power brick or power adapter.

    Techopedia explains Power Supply Most computer power supplies also have an input voltage switch, which can be set to 110v/115v or 220v/240v, depending on the geographic location. This switch position is crucial because of the different power voltages supplied by power outlets in different countries. Most computers now use a switched-mode power supply, which changes AC current to DC voltage. This voltage can be switched on and off electronically. A switched- mode power supply can also shut itself down before damage is done when a short is detected. Most computer power supplies include a number of switched-mode supplies, which operate independently by producing a single voltage. These are linked together, so that they shut down as a group in case of a computer fault.</p>
