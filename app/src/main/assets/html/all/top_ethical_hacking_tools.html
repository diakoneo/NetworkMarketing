    <h1>Top 15 Ethical Hacking Tools Used by InfoSec Professionals</h1>
    <p>Automated tools now rule the Internet; you can find a few to make your social networks grow, others to answer emails automatically, and even bots to help your online customers. Of course, hacking has evolved too: nowadays you can find a lot of automated OSINT Tools that can help anyone with security research and Intel reconnaissance in a way that just wasn‘t possible twenty years ago.<br><br>
    In past decades, ethical hacking and penetration testing were performed by only a few security experts. Now almost anyone can report security incidents. Ethical hacking tools allow you to scan search and find the flaws and vulnerabilities within any company to help make their systems and applications more secure. </p>

    <h2>15 Ethical Hacking Tools You Can’t Miss</h2>
    <p>We‘ve compiled some of the most popular penetration testing tools to help you through the first steps of a security investigation. You‘ll find some of the classic tools that seem to have been around forever and some new tools that might not be familiar.</p>
