        <ul><li>Multilevel Marketing Can Be a Good Thing</li></ul>
        Multilevel marketing (MLM) is an attractive business proposition to many people. It offers the
        opportunity to become involved in a system for distributing products to consumers. Unlike the
        person starting a business from scratch, the MLM participant has the support of a direct
        selling company that supplies the products and sometimes offers training as well.</p>
