        Once you have decided which network marketing company to join and how to sign up with them, follow the steps below to kick-start your business.</p>
        </br></br>

        
        <ul><li>STEP 1: KNOW YOUR WHY</li></ul>
        <p>To be successful in any business, one must first have a dream. Your first step is to determine the WHY. Why do you want to enter network marketing? Is it because you want to be recognized? May be you want to live rich life? A car or a house? Education of your children? You must have a dream to keep you going. Also, ask yourself whether you are ready to commit to it, even if it is one hour a day! In bold, write down your dream.</br></br>
        <strong>ACTIONS</strong> — WRITE YOUR TOP FIVE DREAMS THAT YOU WISH TO FULFILL WITH THIS BUSINESS.</p>

        <ul><li>STEP 2: DECIDE A GOAL</li></ul>
        <p>Each step is going to build a great foundation to your network marketing business. Now that you know why you want to get in network marketing, the second question is how. With help of this guide and your upline (recruiter), decide long term, yearly and monthly goals.

        <strong>Yearly goal</strong> — 2017 — earn my first 30,000
        <strong>Monthly goal</strong> — recruit and train 5 new leads.
        </br></br>
        A goal will help you stay focused and a plan will tell your brain what is needed to be done to reach that goal.</br></br>
        ACTION — WRITE DOWN GOALS ON A PAPER AND DISPLAY IT WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY.</p>

        <ul><li>STEP 3: TAKE TRAININGS OFFERED BY YOUR COMPANY AND LEADER</li></ul>
