    <string name="definition">
        A business model in which a distributor network is needed to build the
        business. Usually such businesses are also multilevel marketing in nature in that payouts
        occur at more than one level. "\n\n"Network marketing is a type of business opportunity that is very popular with people looking
        for part-time, flexible businesses. Some of the best-known companies in America, including
        Avon, Mary Kay Cosmetics, Rain International and Tupperware, fall under the network
        marketing umbrella. "\n\n"

        Network marketing programs feature a low upfront investment-usually only a few hundred
        dollars for the purchase of a product sample kit-and the opportunity to sell a product line
        directly to friend, family and other personal contacts. Most network marketing programs also ask
        participants to recruit other sales representatives. The recruits constitute a reps downline, and
        their sales generate income for those above them in the program."\n\n"

        Things can get sticky when a network marketing network compensates participants primarily for
        recruiting others rather than for selling the companys products or services. A network marketing
        system in which most of the revenue comes from recruitment may be considered an illegal
        pyramid scheme."\n\n"

        Since network marketing programs are usually exempt from business opportunity regulation and
        arent defined as franchises under state and federal franchise laws, youll need to do your own
        investigation before investing any money."\n\n"

    <string name="mlm_and_pyramid_schemes">
        Multilevel Marketing (MLM) and Pyramid Schemes Can Be Very Similar"\n"
        Considering a multilevel marketing opportunity (MLM)? Be careful. It may well be a
        legitimate multilevel marketing business. Or it may be a pyramid scheme - an illegal scam
        designed to steal your money. This article explains the difference between MLM and pyramid
        schemes so you can distinguish between them.

        Multilevel Marketing Can Be a Good Thing"\n"
        Multilevel marketing (MLM) is an attractive business proposition to many people. It offers the
        opportunity to become involved in a system for distributing products to consumers. Unlike the
        person starting a business from scratch, the MLM participant has the support of a direct
        selling company that supplies the products and sometimes offers training as well.

        HOW THE MLM WORKS"\n"
        As a MLM consultant or contractor or distributor (different companies call them different
        things) you make your money by selling the products to other multilevel marketing participants.
        If they are not already a member of your MLM Company, you sign them up."\n\n"Besides earning money off your own sales, you also earn a percentage of the income generated
        by the distributors that you have brought into the program (these are known as your downline).
        Often there are bonuses for selling particular amounts of product or signing up a certain number
        of new members; you can earn cars and trips as well as cash. Sounds good, does not it? And being
        part of a well-run MLM business can be a lot like being a member of a large extended family.

        PYRAMID SCHEMES"\n"
        Unfortunately, not every multilevel marketing opportunity is a legitimate business opportunity.
        Many pyramid schemes, frauds designed to part the unwary from their money, are disguised.

        Like multilevel marketing, pyramid schemes depend on recruiting people to become
        distributors of a product or service. Like MLM, the pyramid scheme offers the opportunity to
        make money by signing up more recruits and by accomplishing certain levels of achievement.

        The big difference between multilevel marketing and pyramid schemes is that MLM is legal
        in Canada (and most of the US) and pyramid schemes are not. Participating in a pyramid scheme
        is an offense under the Criminal Code of Canada, punishable by up to five years imprisonment.

        But it can be very difficult for the person looking for a business opportunity to tell the difference
        between a legitimate MLM opportunity and a pyramid scheme at a glance. How do you tell
        whether it is a legitimate business opportunity or a scam?

        Unlike MLM, Pyramid Schemes Have Only One Purpose
        The big difference between MLM and a pyramid scheme is in the way the business operates.
        The entire purpose of a pyramid scheme is to get your money and then use you to recruit other
        suckers (ahem - distributors).

        The entire purpose of MLM is to move product. The theory behind MLM is that the larger the
        network of distributors, the more product the business will be able to sell.

        Use these questions as an acid test if youre in the least doubt as to whether the opportunity
        youre considering is multilevel marketing or a pyramid scheme:

        Checklist for Recognizing a Pyramid Scheme:
        Are you required to invest a large amount of money up front to become a distributor? This
                        investment request may be disguised as an inventory charge. Legitimate MLM businesses do not
                        require large startup costs.

                        Are you required to "invest" a large amount of money up front to become a distributor? Legitimate MLM companies will offer and stick to inventory buy-backs for at least 80% of what you paid.

                        Is there any mention of or attention paid to a market for the product or service?Multilevel marketing depends on establishing a market for the companys products. If the company doesnt
                        seem to have any interest in consumer demand for its products, dont sign up.

                        Is there more emphasis on recruitment than on selling the product or service? Remember, the
                        difference between multilevel marketing and a pyramid scheme is in the focus. The pyramid scheme focuses on fast profits from signing people up and getting their money. If recruitment seems to be the focus of the plan, run.

              These next two questions will help you determine what the focus of the company is:

                        Is the plan designed so that you make more money by recruiting new members rather than through sales that you make yourself? This is the signature of a pyramid scheme operation.

                        Are you offered commissions for recruiting new members?Another pyramid scheme trademark. Its the number of people who are willing to sign up that matter in a pyramid scheme, not the products or services being offered.


    Pyramid Scheme vs. MLM: How to Protect Yourself
    As always, when youre investigating a potential business opportunity, youll want to gather all
        the information you can about the MLM Company‘s products and operations.

    Get (and read) written copies of the companys sales literature, business plan and/or marketing
    plan.


    Talk to other people who have experience with the multilevel marketing company and the
    products to determine whether the products are actually being sold and if they are of high
    quality.


    Check with the Better Business Bureau to see if there have been any complaints about the
    company.


    And listen carefully when youre at that MLM recruitment meeting. Inflated claims for the
    amazing amounts of money youre going to make should set your alarm bells ringing.


    Being part of a successful multilevel marketing company can be both profitable and fun, but
    unfortunately, some purported MLM opportunities are actually just cons designed to flatten
    both your wallet and your dream of running a business.

        Better Alternatives to MLMs
If you are looking to start a full or part-time business, there are many other proven business
ideas that are alternatives to MLMs


Is Network Marketing a Good Career?
Network marketing is a good career for a select few. It will be a waste for most others. As with any business, a successful multi-level marketing (MLM) venture will require a significant investment of time and effort. Done correctly, it‘s a great way to build wealth. But there‘s no room for people who think they can make a quick buck with it.

    </string>

    <string name="network_marketing">
        Network marketing is a referral-based sales business. A company will offer a product or a service and recruit others to sell it for them. Sales reps, who are independent contractors and not employees, are paid commissions for what they sell. If they recruit other reps, then they‘ll also earn a portion of their sales, too.


    As a basic example, let‘s imagine that a company uses an MLM model to sell laptops. You might join because for each one you sell, you‘ll earn a 10% commission. If you recruit me into the business, you‘d also earn a 2% commission on each laptop I sell. And if I recruit someone else, you‘d earn 0.5% on each one they sell, and so on.

What are the advantages of MLM?
The greatest advantage of multi-level marketing is that you can build a thriving business without having to develop a product or a brand. The company provides it for you; all you need to do is selling. A well-managed firm will have systems and marketing material available to bolster your chances of success.

    It‘s also scalable. You can develop your business into a vast enterprise with numerous layers of recruits. If you‘re willing to invest the time, eventually you can have enough sales reps on your
    team to walk away from it altogether. A network marketing venture can thus be an effective income producing asset. There are plenty of MLM entrepreneurs who earn six and seven-figure incomes passively.

    Further, MLM is a great way to develop sales, public speaking, leadership and management skills. I often suggest it to aspiring entrepreneurs who haven‘t yet decided what they want to pursue. Network marketing may not make you rich overnight, but it can teach much of what you need to know to have a successful business. You can use it as a training ground.

    Lastly, a lot of people find value from the mentorship and personal develop components involved in network marketing. If you participate in MLM, you‘ll join a community of like-minded others. Your peers will want to reach financial freedom, they‘ll stand by their product, they‘ll believe in their mission and they want to expand their skillset. That‘s valuable in and of itself.


    Are there downsides to network
Yes – and they are plentiful. You should be aware of them before proceeding.
Scams
The MLM world is a hotbed for scams and shady characters. Companies like Business in Motion were found to be Ponzi schemes. Karatbars international, OneCoin, MMM and several others have all had run-ins with the authorities. In December 2016, Vemma paid a $238 million settlement to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for non-compliance issues. I‘d suggest reading sites like BehindMLM.com and ThompsonBurton.com to keep abreast of current events

Changing regulatory framework
Trade and securities regulators have pushed network marketing companies to base their compensation models on sales commissions, rather than on recruitment. They take issue with firms who pay people to simply find others to join instead of actually selling the product (Vemma, for instance). It‘s likely that regulators will continue to scrutinize the MLM
Your asset can disappear
 the company folds or terminates its relationship with you that will destroy the asset you spent years building. MLM participants are reliant on the good standing of the company. One way to hedge against that risk to is to maintain close relationships with those in your downline. They would then be more likely to come with you if you choose to switch businesses.


    Most network marketing businesses come with some sort of fee to join. It will usually be in the form of a minimum monthly product purchase, a start-up fee or an annual membership expense. Moreover, there are often incentives to pay more in order to upgrade or qualify for higher bonuses.


    You could also look at it from a different perspective, though. Most small businesses come with start-up costs. Paying a few hundred or a few thousand dollars to participate is cheaper than a lot of other ventures.

    Note: an MLM company should never use the word “investment.” That would imply the distribution of securities and likely poor grasp of the law. If you are asked to invest in a network marketing business, run for the hills. MLM is a business opportunity, not an investment opportunity. Aside from the legal distinctions, one is passive while the other is active. They are not interchangeable terms.


Is network marketing a good career?
Network marketing can be a great career, contingent on a few factors. They include

The effort you make
Most people become disillusioned with network marketing because they expect to make money quickly. After a few months of dismal results, they either quit or become inactive. Even worse, they often write off the experience as a scam. To be clear: MLM is a small business. Just like any other entrepreneur, you‘ve got to work hard for years before you‘ll see results. If that‘s not an option, then network marketing (and business in general) is not right for you.

div class="finding
Finding the right company
There are a lot of MLM junkies; people who hop from one network marketing firm to the next. They abandon the former each time a shiny new business opportunity arises. Frequently jumping ship will preclude you from spending enough time on your venture. You‘ve got to find the right firm and stick with it. As part of your due diligence, you should consider:

     hidden costs
    The compensation plan (is it lucrative? Is it sales-based or recruitment-based?)
    Legal or compliance issues

While researching prospective companies, you‘ll probably find websites that call them scams. I‘ve never seen an MLM business without bad press online. There will always be someone who says they were ripped off. In my opinion, you should base your conclusions on evidence. Sometimes, where there‘s smoke there‘s fire. Other times, however, people are either disgruntled or they‘re trying to drive traffic to their own network marketing venture. Don‘t ignore what you read online, but strive to understand the context in which it was written.


Your tolerance for volatility
Income in any business is never stable, nor is it guaranteed. As an early MLM entrepreneur, you may experience months of decent earnings followed by droughts. The business won‘t produce reliable passive income for at least a few years. Such volatility can be stressful and emotionally draining, especially for those with high expenses. You should be prepared for earnings swings and manage the money you do make carefully.

How you spend your earnings
It‘s common to spend your network marketing earnings on upgrades and training packages. The company will often encourage you to do so, justifying it as an “investment in yourself.” While there‘s truth to that, people often go overboard. They‘ll dump most of what they make right back into the firm, leaving little for themselves. Doing that too often can dry you out.

As a rule of thumb, you should try to invest in activities that will directly produce revenue. For example, if you spend $200 at a hotel to host a recruitment seminar, you might make $1,000 from it. That‘s opposed to spending $200 on sales training and justifying it by saying, “Well, the skills I develop will be worth it.” Continually purchasing programs and activities that have indirect potential can be a dangerous
Conclusion
Network marketing can be a good career to pursue. You can do quite well if you build a team of hard-working individuals. The passive income that can be produced is vast. It is certainly a vehicle to reach financial

LM has pitfalls. Perhaps the main one is people being convinced that it will lead to easy money and then discovering the truth afterwards. If you make an informed decision and work hard towards success, then I‘d encourage it. If you can‘t commit to that, though, look elsewhere for opportunities.

Can you make money from network marketing
Multi-level marketing, sometimes referred to as network marketing, companies typically give you several ways to earn. First, you can profit by marketing the companys products to
others. You can also use the products yourself and essentially become your own customer. Finally, you can recruit others.

    </string>

    <string name="scam_or_slam_dunk">

I recently accepted a friend‘s invite for an evening get-together. As soon as I arrived, I realized I wasn‘t coming over for the usual conversation and cocktails. “I have this amazing opportunity to share with you!” she said enthusiastically.


    The opportunity turned out to be a multi-level marketing presentation for a company that provides satellite services and utilities. I could earn money by simply signing up friends and relatives for services they used anyway. But if I really wanted to make money, I could recruit them to become company representatives underneath me and earn a percentage of their sales, on top what I‘d earn from mine.


    Not surprisingly, the presentation ignited a firestorm within our circle of friends between those who saw it as an opportunity and those who didn‘t.

    This debate isn’t a new one. Here are the arguments for and against multi-level marketing.


What is Multi-Level Marketing?>
Contrary to what some people think, multi-level marketing is not a pyramid scheme.


    In a pyramid scheme, you earn money by bringing in people underneath you, not by selling a product. As long as a company has a product available for sale to the general public, it’s a legitimate business, according to the Federal Trade Commission‘s 1979 ruling on Amway. (Here’s more information on what the FTC considers multi-level marketing.)


    Multi-level marketing, sometimes referred to as network marketing, companies typically give you several ways to earn.


    First, you can profit by marketing the company’s products to others. You can also use the products yourself and essentially become your own customer. Finally, you can recruit others. Most multi-level marketing companies give you a percentage of whatever sales those underneath you make. With each level that comes in underneath you, you earn a higher percentage of the sale‘s profit.


    Again, it is not a pyramid scheme, because your earnings are based on the sale of actual products.<p>

The Argument for Multi-level Marketing
According to its proponents, if you want to ditch your 9-to-5 job, start your own business or become your own boss, multi-level marketing is one of the cheapest and easiest ways to do so.

    You may have to invest money in products to show to potential customers, or pay a sign-up fee (my friend’s company required a $500 fee to get started).

    However, when you consider what it costs to open other types of businesses, a few hundred dollars isn‘t much.


    “If you were purchasing a small business like a Subway franchise, the initial outlay would be over $100,000, and you would need a networth of $500,000 to be approved,” says Garrett Sanders, who operates his own network marketing business in North Carolina.


“How long would it take to recoup that investment?”


    Multi-level marketing also has a built-in mentorship program. The people who recruit you have a vested (financial) interest in seeing you succeed.


    Not only will those above you help you with presentations and answer questions, but most companies offer regular meetings with your peers to discuss strategies, motivational programs and additional training resources.


    With hard work, you can make money, but how much depends on the company you work with and the product. It’s extremely unlikely you’ll make an extraordinary amount of money overnight.

    Surprisingly, money isn‘t the only reason people become involved with multi-level marketing businesses. Many people, especially stay-at-home parents and retirees, use their businesses to get out of the house, meet new people, learn new skills and do something that gives them a sense of accomplishment.</p>


The Argument against Multi-level Marketing
Jon M. Taylor knows firsthand how multi-level marketing works. After a successful sales career, first selling encyclopedias and then insurance, he decided to give multi-level marketing a try. He threw himself into a multi-level marketing program, rose to the “level of about the top 1% of distributors”… and still didn’t turn a profit. Taylor, an industry expert who runs the website MLM-theTruth.com, says multi-level marketing is designed so profits flow up. More than 99% of people who get involved with multi-level marketing programs don‘t earn a profit, according to his research. In addition, many don’t even make enough money to cover their expenses, which can include purchasing products, paying membership dues and traveling to events.


    But there are other, non-financial reasons to avoid multi-level marketing programs, he says.


    One is the toll they can take on personal relationships. When she realized their friends and family were avoiding them, Taylor‘s wife told him it was her or the program. Another is the emotional challenge. Recruits are often told if they follow the program, they‘ll turn a profit, Taylor says.

    When they don‘t succeed, they‘re told it‘s because they‘re doing something wrong, even though he contends the products are usually overpriced and inferior to what is available elsewhere



The Bottom Line
If you‘re a considering signing up for a multi-level marketing program, ask questions. Find out about the product and get the company‘s refund policy in writing.

    The FTC provides guidance on how to steer clear of pyramid schemes and fraudulent businesses.

    <string name="business_model">

        A business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social, cultural or other contexts. The process of business model construction and modification is also called business model innovation and forms a part of business strategy.


What is a Business Model?
    A Business Model is a conceptual structure that supports the viability of a product or company and explains how the company operates, makes money, and how it intends to achieve its goals. All the business processes and policies that a company adopts and follows are part of the business model.


According to management guru Peter Drucker:
    A business model is supposed to answer who your customer is, what value you can create/add for the customer and how you can do that at reasonable costs.


    Thus a business model is a description of the rationale of how a company creates, delivers and captures value for itself as well as the customer.


    The widespread use of business models came into existence with the advent of the personal computer which let people test and model the different components of a business. Successful business models before that were mostly created by accident and not by design. It‘s different for business plans and business strategies though.



Every business model intrinsically has three parts
Everything related to designing and manufacturing the product
Everything related to selling the product, from finding the right customers to distributing the product
Everything related to how the customer will pay and how the company will make money




Different Types of Business Models
      There are different types of business models meant for different businesses. Some of the basic types of business models are:

Manufacturer
A manufacturer makes finished products from raw materials. It may sell directly to the customers or sell it to a middleman i.e. another business that sells it finally to the customer. Ex: Ford, 3M, General Electric.

Distributor
A distributor buys products from manufacturers and resells them to the retailers or the public. Ex: Auto Dealerships.

Retailer
A retailer sells directly to the public after purchasing the products from a distributor or wholesaler. Ex: Amazon, Tesco.

Franchise
A franchise can be a manufacturer, distributor or retailer. Instead of creating a new product, the franchisee uses the parent business‘s model and brand while paying royalties to it. Ex: McDonald’s, Pizza Hut.


Brick-and-mortar
Brick-and-mortar is a traditional business model where the retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers deal with the customers face-to-face in an office, a shop, or a store that the business owns or rents.


eCommerce
E-Commerce business model is an upgradation of the traditional brick-and-mortar business model. It focuses on selling products by creating a web-store on the internet.


Bricks-and-clicks
A company that has both an online and offline presence allows customers to pick up products from the physical stores while they can place the order online. This model gives flexibility to the business since it is present online for customers who live in areas where they do not have brick-and-mortar stores. Ex: Almost all apparel companies nowadays.


Nickel-and-dime
In this model, the basic product provided to the customers is very cost-sensitive and hence priced as low as possible. For every other service that comes with it, a certain amount is charged. Ex: All low-cost air carriers.

This model gives flexibility to the business since it is present online for customers who live in areas where they do not have brick-and-mortar stores. Ex: Almost all apparel companies nowadays.


Freemium
This is one of the most common business models on the Internet. Companies offer basic services to the customers for free while charging a certain premium for extra add-ons. So there will be multiple plans with various benefits for different customers. Generally, the basic service comes with certain restrictions or limitations, such as in-app advertisements, storage restrictions etc., which the premium plans shall not have. For example, the basic version of Dropbox comes with 2 GB storage. If you want to increase that limit, you can move to the Pro plan and pay a premium of $9.99 a month for it. Some online image editors allow you to edit only a certain number of images in the free basic plan while an unlimited number of images in the paid plan. YouTube’s free plan comes with ads while the premium (Red) plan has no ad interruption plus it has other benefits too. This model is one of the most adopted models for online companies because it is not only a great marketing tool but also a cost-effective way to scale up and attract new users.


Subscription
If customer acquisition costs are high, this business model might be the most suitable option. The subscription business model lets you keep customers over a long-term contract and get recurring revenues from them through repeat purchases. Ex: Netflix, Dollar Shave Club.


Aggregator
Aggregator business model is a recently developed model where the company various service providers of a niche and sell their services under its own brand. The money is earned as commissions. Ex. Uber, Airbnb, Oyo.


Online Marketplace
Online marketplaces aggregate different sellers into one platform who then compete with each other to provide the same product/service at competitive prices. The marketplace builds its brand over different factors like trust, free and/or on-time home delivery, quality sellers, etc. and earns commission on every sale carried on its platform. Ex. Amazon, Alibaba.


Advertisement
Advertisement business models are evolving even more with the rise of the demand for free products and services on the internet. Just like the earlier times, these business models are popular with media publishers like YouTube, Forbes, etc. where the information is provided for free but are accompanied with advertisements which are paid for by identified sponsors.


Data Licensing / Data Selling
With the advent of the internet, there has been an increase in the amount of data generated upon the users‘ activities over the internet. This has led to the advent of a new business model – the data licensing business model. Many companies like Twitter and One signal sell or license the data of its users or users of users to third parties which then use the same for analysis, advertising, and other purposes.


Agency-Based
An agency can be considered as a partner company which specialises in handling the non-core business activities like advertising, digital marketing, PR, ORM, etc. This company partners with several other companies that outsource their non-core tasks to them and is responsible to maintain privacy and efficiency in their work. Examples of such agencies are Ogilvy and Mathers, Dentsu Aegis Network, etc.


Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing business model is a commission-based model where the affiliate builds its business around promoting a partner‘s product and directs all its efforts to convince its followers and users to buy the same. In return, the affiliate gets a commission for every sale referred. An example of a business operating on affiliate marketing business model is lifewire.com.


Dropshipping
Dropshipping is a type of e-commerce business model where the business owns no product or inventory but just a store. The actual product is sold by partner sellers who receive the order as soon as the store receives an order from the ultimate customer. These partner sellers then deliver the products directly to the customer.


Crowdsourcing
Crowdsourcing business model involves the users to contribute to the value provided. This business model is often combined with other business and revenue models to create an ultimate solution for the user and to earn money. Examples of businesses using crowdsourcing business model are Wikipedia, reCAPTCHA, Duolingo, etc.


Peer 2 Peer Catalyst/Platform
A P2P economy is a decentralized internet-based economy where two parties interact directly with each other to buy or sell goods or to conduct a transaction without the intervention of any third party. A P2P catalyst is a platform where these users meet. Examples of P2P platforms are Craigslist, OLX, Airbnb etc.


Blockchain


SAAS, IAAS, PAAS
Many companies have started offering their software, platform, and infrastructure as a service. The ‗as a service‘ business model works on the principle of pay as you go where the customer pays for his usage of such software, platform, and infrastructure; he pays for what and how many features he has used and not for what he hasn‘t.


High Touch
The High Touch model is one which requires lots of human interaction. The relationship between the salesperson and the customer has a huge impact on the overall revenues of the company. The companies with this business model operate on trust and credibility. Ex: Hair salons, consulting firms.


Low Touch
The opposite of the High Touch model, the Low Touch model requires minimal human assistance or intervention in selling a product or service. Since as a company, you do not have to maintain a huge sales force, your costs decrease, though such companies also focus on improving technology to further reduce human intervention while making the customer experience better at the same time. Ex: IKEA, Survey Monkey.


    Of course, most companies do not operate on any one of these business models but rather on a combination of some. Like it is perfectly possible for you to be a Bricks-and-clicks Low Touch Retailer or a High Touch Subscription-Based Manufacturer. What business model you choose depends on your business needs and what value you want to create for your stakeholders. Next, we will see how to develop the perfect business model for your startup, so that the chances of your success are amplified.

        10 MOST COMMON BUSINESS MODELS TO MAKE A PROFIT
    One of the most critical elements of any sustainable business is achieving a positive cash-flow. Without that, even the best intentions will fail.
        By Martin Zwilling Founder and CEO, Startup Professionals


    I was mentoring some graduate students at a local university recently, and I sensed that profit seems to be a dirty word these days to many aspiring entrepreneurs. Im certainly not a fan of customer rip-offs, but even non-profits have to be cash-flow positive, or have deep pockets, to help anyone for long. Every business needs to develop a revenue model even before a product.


    The alternatives range from giving the product away for free (revenue from ads), to pricing based on costs, to charging what the market will bear (premium pricing). The implications of the decision you make are huge, including brand image, funding requirements, and long-term business viability.


    Its naïve to think you can sell below costs, and make it up by attracting more customers.


    This may seem like Business Fundamentals 101, but the market changes rapidly, so I thought it might be useful to share what I see as the most common revenue models being used by businesses today.


    As an experienced business advisor, here is my current summary, with some of the pros and cons or special considerations for each:


Product is free, revenue is from advertisers.
This is the most common model used by online businesses and apps today, the so-called Facebook model, where your service is free, and the revenue comes from advertising.
The challenge is to get the first million customers, before advertisers will sign up. Facebook spent $150 million getting started.


Freemium model - people pay for upgrade.
In this variation on the free model, used by LinkedIn and many other online and app offerings, the basic function is free, but premium services are only available for an additional fee.
This also requires a base critical mass, and real work to differentiate and convert users to paying customers.

Price based on product costs plus margin.
In this more traditional product pricing model, the price is set at two to five times the product cost to cover overhead and operational expenses.
If your product is a commodity, the margin may be as thin as ten percent. Use it when your new technology gives you a tremendous cost improvement.

Price based on average value to customer
If you can quantify a large value or cost savings to the customer, greater than your cost, charge a price commensurate with the value delivered. This doesnt work well with "nice to have" an offering, like social networks, but does work for new drugs and medical devices that solve critical health problems.


Price with recurring low subscription payments
This is a very popular model today for Internet services, with monthly or yearly payments, in lieu of one higher up-front price.

Advantages for your business include a stable revenue stream, customer retention, and increasing customer investment over time. The customer advantage is a lower entry cost.


Tiered pricing based on volume on customer scope
In product environments, where an enterprise product may have one user or hundreds of thousands, a common approach is to price by user ranges, or volume usage limits.

Keep the number of tiers small for manageability. This approach doesnt typically apply to consumer products and services.

    Revenue is a percentage of every transaction.
This is another popular model for platforms, e-commerce, and affiliates, where you as the transaction or product provider get a small percentage or royalty on every ultimate sale to customers by others. Amazon led the way on this one online, but distributors have long used this model in retail


Low product price, but support is extra
In this model, the product price is attractive or free, but the customers are charged for installation, customization, training and other services.

This model is good for getting your foot in the door, but it is basically a services business with the product as a marketing cost. Customers generally dislike this model.


Low entry price, with priced features additional
This approach works if your product can be configured "bare-bones" for a low price, and additional features priced separately.

It is a very competitive approach, but requires design and development effort for value at every level. Expect extra costs for development, testing, documentation, and support.


Low price base, make money on disposables
With this model, popularly called the razor-blade model, the base unit is often sold below cost, with the anticipation of ongoing revenue from expensive supplies. Today, think cheap printers with expensive ink cartridges. This is another model that requires deep pockets to start, so be careful.

    If you dont like any of these models, you can always try the non-revenue model, sometimes called the Twitter model, where you count on investors to sustain your costs while your valuation increases exponentially based on millions of customers. The nonprofit version of this is a service so valuable and recognized, like UNICEF, that you never run out of donors and philanthropists.

    Yet smart people dont count on being one of these, and have a plan to validate their business model, concurrent with their plan to validate their solution. Certainly you shouldnt be afraid of using the word "profit" in your discussions with a business advisor, potential investors, partners, and even customers.

    A reasonable profit will make your idea a reality for all, rather than a dream.




What is business model in business plan?

Difference between business plan and business model. The business model is the mechanism through which the company generates its profit while the business plan is a document presenting the companys strategy and expected financial performance for the years to come.

Business Model vs. Business Plan
Business plan and business model are 2 completely different notions. Whats the difference between the 2?

Difference between business plan and business model
The business model is the mechanism through which the company generates its profit while the business plan is a document presenting the companys strategy and expected financial performance for the years to come.

    As you can see, the business model is at the center of the business plan.

    The business model describes how the company is positioned within its industrys value chain, and how it organizes its relations with its suppliers, clients, and partners in order to generate profits. The business plan translates this positioning in a series of strategic actions and quantifies their financial impact.

Examples of business models
Here are some examples of the most common business models:
 class=examples"Production
Advertising
Commission
Subscription
Freemium
Accessories

Lets dive in to these examples in greater details.

The business model of production
It is the most basic business model, the company sales the products and services it produces. In order for that business model to be viable, the company needs to generate enough sales to cover its production, distribution, and storage costs.

    The advertising business model
    Here the goal is to generate revenues by selling advertising space.
    On the Internet this model can be segmented based on the type of advertising:
 class="examples"CPM (cost per thousand): the advertiser pays the publisher a fixed amount for 1,000 impressions.
    CPC (cost per click): the advertiser pays the publisher every time someone clicks on the ad. The amount paid can be fixed or established through an auction process.
    CPA (cost per action): the advertiser pays every time a specific action is executed. An action can be a sale or a lead for example. The amount can be fixed or set as a percentage of the action value.
    This business model is already slightly more complex than the production one given that the company first need to invest in order to create a large audience before it can attract advertisers.

    Business model based on commission (or distribution)
    The company acts as an intermediary between the seller and the buyer and takes a cut of every sell it helps generate.
        This business model is generally less risky than the 2 previous ones (and therefore less profitable) as the level of investment required can be minimal.

    The subscription business model
    The company receives revenues from its subscribers at regular intervals. This business model has one clear advantage: the company knows in advance how much revenues it is going to generate. The flip side is that it often takes several months to recover the subscriber acquisition costs leading to a lower cash generation at the beginning of the cycle.

    The freemium business model
    The company offers 2 versions of its product. A free version with a limited set of features which goals are either to raise awareness about the product or to create a network effect. And a paid version, comprising more features, from which it can generate enough margin to cover the cost of the free users.
The keys to success with this business model are to be able to generate huge network effect (example: LinkedIn) and/or to convert a sufficient number of free users into paid customers (example: Uservoice).

The accessories business model
The company offers one product for free or at a price close to its production cost and generates a profit on the sale of accessories. The classic example of this business model is the sale of razor blades: razors are sold for nothing but you have to continually buy expensive blades to be able to use it.
    These lists of business models is far from being exhaustive, and if you have questions regarding a business model in particular feel free to ask it using the comment form below.

    <string name="direct_marketing">
    Direct marketing is an advertising strategy that relies on the individual distribution of a sales pitch to potential customers. Mail, email, and texting are among the delivery systems used. It is called direct marketing because it generally eliminates the middleman such as advertising media.

   How Direct Marketing Works
   Unlike most marketing campaigns, direct marketing campaigns do not rely on advertising in mass media. Instead, they deliver their sales pitches by mail, by phone, or by email. Although the numbers of pitches sent can be massive, an attempt is often made to personalize the message, inserting the recipients name or city in a prominent place.


    The call to action is a common factor in much of direct marketing. The recipient of the message is urged to immediately respond by calling a toll-free phone number, sending in a reply card, or clicking on a link in an email promotion. Any response is a positive indicator of a prospective purchase. This variety of direct marketing is often called direct response marketing.
Targeting in Direct Marketing
The most effective direct marketing campaigns use lists of targeted prospects in order to send their messages only to the likeliest prospects. The lists might target families who have recently had a baby, or new homeowners, or recent retirees with products or services that they are most likely to need.

    Catalogs are a form of direct marketing with a history that dates back to the latter half of the 19th century. In modern times, catalogs are usually sent only to consumers who have indicated an interest by a previous purchase of a similar product.

The Advantages and Disadvantages of Direct Marketing
A direct marketing pitch that is delivered to the widest possible audience is probably the least effective. That is, the company may gain a few customers while merely annoying all of the other recipients. Junk mail, spam email, and texting all are forms of direct marketing that many people cant get rid of fast enough.


    Many companies engage in opt-in or permission marketing, which limits their mailing or emailing to people who have indicated a willingness to receive it. Lists of opt-in subscribers are particularly valuable as they indicate a real interest in the products or services being advertised.

Who Uses Direct Marketing
Despite its drawbacks, direct marketing has its appeal, particularly to companies on a shoestring budget who cant afford to pay for television or internet advertising campaigns.
    Direct marketing is the preferred advertising strategy for small local businesses, which can distribute hundreds of fliers, coupons, or menus for less than it would cost them to place an ad or make a commercial.

    By its nature, the effectiveness of a direct marketing campaign is easier to measure than other types of advertising. This is because they often contain a call to action. The company and measure its success by how many consumers make the call, return the card, use the coupon, or click on the link.

Key Takeaways
Direct marketing relies on distribution to individual consumers rather than advertising in mass media.
The call to action is a common factor in much of direct marketing.
The effectiveness of direct marketing is easier to measure than media advertising.


Direct marketing fundamentals
Direct marketing occurs when the “producer” connects with the end user. The end user may be a consumer or a business.

    Direct marketing applies to product and service-oriented businesses, and to nonprofit organizations. In all situations, there is no intermediary involved. Direct marketing describes this interactive communication with the end user.

    Direct marketing is not synonymous with mass marketing. The most effective direct marketing takes place when there is a clear connection to reach the target market.

    Organizations may use several ways to leverage direct marketing as they communicate with and deliver products to their customers. This may include using a direct sales force, catalogs, websites, email, direct mail, telemarketing, seminars, trade shows, and other ―one-to-one‖ techniques to communicate and sell to their customers and clients.

    Some of these direct marketing methods have grown dramatically, especially with the growth of marketing over the Internet. There is evidence that other direct marketing approaches have diminished, such as reports that the response to direct mail is often below one percent compared to the five percent+ response rate numbers more commonly experienced in the past.

Companies may choose to leverage direct marketing exclusively:

   Types of Direct Marketing
    The most common forms of direct marketing are:
      Face- to-face selling Internet marketing
        Direct mail
    Catalogs
   Telemarketing
Direct-response advertising
Kiosk marketing




Let‘s look at these in more detail:
Internet Marketing
The Internet has revolutionized direct marketing for promoting the sale of products and services to targeted audiences. Access to the Internet provides users with services in four basic areas:
i. Information
ii. Entertainment
iii. Shopping
iv. Individual and group communication

Online channels can eliminate geographic considerations. With this capability people around the world have the same access as the person across the street. Many businesses that can sell their products and services through downloading, or who can economically ship those products, have discovered an entirely new way to market.

The Internet makes direct marketing easier, more targeted, more flexible, more responsive, more affordable, and potentially more profitable than ever. Virtually every business should seriously consider the Internet as a part of their marketing mix and determine if it is a viable fit for their direct marketing efforts.



Face-to-Face Selling

The most traditional direct marketing involves the in-house sales force personally contacting potential and established consumers. Examples of organizations that use face-to-face selling include:
i. Mary Kay
ii. Avon
iii. Amway


Direct Mail
Direct mail is described as sending information about a special offer, product or sale announcement, service reminder, or some other type of communication to a person at a particular street or electronic address. Historically direct mail has existed in the form of printed materials, but CDs, audio tapes, video tapes, fax mail, email, and voice mail are also used in direct mail campaigns. For example, America Online experienced a highly successful campaign through mailing out CD-ROMs to prospective customers. Direct mail permits high target-market selectivity; it can be personalized, it is flexible, and it allows early testing and response measurement to take place. A highly selective and accurate mailing list often determines the success of direct mail efforts to enhance response rates and control costs.

Catalogs
Product catalogs are another version of direct mail where the catalogs are the communication tool. The most common use of this approach involves featuring a variety of products that target the needs of a specific audience who have shown a propensity to order from catalogs. An increasing number of business-to-business marketers are sending catalogs on CD-ROM to prospects and customers. The average U.S. household receives more than 50 catalogs each year, ranging from general merchandise to specialty goods.
Examples of general merchandise catalogs are:
i. Spiegel
ii. J.C. Penny

Examples of specialty goods catalogs are:
i. Pottery Barn
ii. PC Connection

Telemarketing
    The process of contacting people on a qualified list to sell services over the phone has grown in popularity to the point that the average household receives 19 telemarketing calls each year. Successful telemarketing campaigns depend on a good calling list, an effective script and contact structure, and well-trained people that are compensated and rewarded for making calls that result in sales. The telecommunications industry, for example, has used telemarketing extensively to attempt to increase their market share.
This includes:
i. ATT
ii. MCI WorldCom
iii. Sprint

>Direct-Response Advertising
Direct-response advertising is communicating with potential buyers through television, radio, magazines, and newspapers. The prospective consumer watches, hears, or reads about the product or service and initiates a call to a toll-free number to place their order. Television, for example, offers a wide range of exposure, from a 30-second commercial to a 60-minute infomercial.
Kiosk Marketing
Customer order machines, versus vending machines that actually provide products, are another form of direct marketing. Examples are:
i. Eddie Bauer: Stores place computer terminals to order from the entire line of products not available in the retail store.
ii. Florsheim Shoe Company Your bank‘s automatic teller machines (ATMs) placed in convenient and high traffic areas are another example of kiosk marketing. A combination of these direct marketing techniques may offer the optimal revenue generating solution

        BIOS

	BIOS may refer to any of the following:
    Short for Basic Input/output System, the BIOS (pronounced bye-oss) is a ROM chip found on motherboards that allows you to access and set up your computer system at the most basic level. In the picture below, is an example of what a BIOS chip may look like on your computer motherboard.

    In this case, this is a picture of an early AMIBIOS, a type of BIOS manufactured by AMI.

    CMOS may refer to any of the following:
    Alternatively referred to as a Real-Time Clock (RTC), Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) or CMOS RAM, CMOS is short for Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor. CMOS is an on-board, battery powered semiconductor chip inside computers that stores information. This information ranges from the system time and date to system hardware settings for your computer. The picture shows an example of the most common CMOS coin cell battery (Panasonic CR 2032 3V) used to power the CMOS memory.


    The Motorola 146818 chip was the first RTC and CMOS RAM chip to be used in early IBM computers; capable of storing a total of 64 bytes of data. Since the system clock used 14 bytes of RAM, this left an additional 50bytes for storing system settings. Today, most computers have moved the settings from CMOS and integrated them into the Southbridge or Super I/O chips. Picture below;

How long does the CMOS battery last?
The standard lifetime of a CMOS battery is around 10 Years. However, this can vary depending on the use and environment in which the computer resides.

How would I know if my CMOS battery is failing?
If the CMOS battery is failing the computer cannot keep the correct time or date on the computer after it has been turned off. For example, after turning your computer on you may notice the time has been set to 12:00 PM and the date is set back to January 1, 1990, if the CMOS battery has failed.

For example, a bus enables a computer processor to communicate with the memory or a video card to communicate with the memory. The bus contains multiple wires (signal lines) that contain addressing information that describes the memory location of where the data is being sent or where it is being retrieved. Each wire in the bus carries a single bit of information, which means the more wires a bus has the more information it can address. For example, a computer with a 32-bit address bus can address 4 GB of memory, and a computer with a 36-bit bus can address 64 GB of memory. You can think of it as a public transportation or school bus.

        Note: Bus is not an acronym for anything.

        A bus is capable of being a parallel or serial bus and today all computers utilize two bus types, an internal bus or local bus and an external bus, also called the expansion bus.
        An internal bus enables communication between internal components such as a card and memory.
        An external bus is capable of communicating with external components such as a USB or SCSI device.
        A computer or devices bus speed is listed in MHz, e.g. 100 MHz FSB. The throughput of a bus is measured in second or megabytes per second.

     hat Are Three Types of Buses on a Motherboard?
    A computer sends several kinds of electronic signals back and forth among its various components. For efficiency, separate paths on the motherboard called buses each carry only one kind of signal; this boosts the computers speed and simplifies its operation. While PC motherboards have different buses for expansion cards and external devices, all computers have three fundamental buses: Control, Instruction and Address. The whole system operates through these buses.

    Bus Architecture
         Computers consist of several main functional units, including the central processor, memory and input/output. The central processor performs basic arithmetic and logic, memory stores programs and data, and input/output routes data to the computers keyboard, screen and hard drive. These parts communicate with each other. Some computer designs use a single bus shared by all parts. While in expensive, the system must manage its signals carefully, and some parts wait until others finish communicating and relinquish control of the bus.

    Multiple buses reduce the waiting time and keep the parts running efficiently. The layout of a computers buses and parts is called its bus architecture

    Control Bus
    The motherboards control bus manages the activity in the system. The control bus, like the other buses, is simply a set of connections among the parts in the computer. All parts "agree to recognize" that if one connection carries a voltage and the next one does not, it means that the central processor reads from memory. If the connections reverse roles, the processor writes to memory. Other connections deal with the "chunking" of data 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits at a time. Still others determine if data is being shuttled to the central processor from memory or the keyboard. This signaling system prevents data from going to the wrong place.

    Data Bus
    The data bus acts as a conduit for data from the keyboard, memory and other devices. It passes information at speeds up to billions of characters per second. The central processor reads the data, performs calculations, and moves new data back to memory, the hard drive and other locations. The control bus determines which direction the data is moving.

    Address Bus
    The computer must be able to access every character of memory rapidly, so every character has its own address number. The central processor specifies which addresses it wants to read or write and the address bus carries this information to a memory controller circuit, which locates and fetches the information. Some locations, called random-access memory, hold program instructions and temporary calculation results. Other locations point to the hard drive, mouse and keyboard. The control bus specifies which of these two sets of addresses become active for a particular memory operation.

    The Brains
    In the first module, we saw a simple block diagram of the computer processing data and creating information. This is simply an update with some of the hardware we talked about shown (along with some sample I/O devices). Its still simple!

    Lots of people call the CPU the brain of the computer - an overly simple analogy. But if were going to use it, lets include the brains short-term or working memory, RAM with cache being even shorter-term memory. If you share my distaste for the label of "brain", we can call it the computers "processor system".

    <string name="computer_hardware">
        Computer hardware is the physical parts or components of a computer, such as the monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphic card, sound card and motherboard. By contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and ran by hardware. Hardware is directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system. There are a number of different types of computer system in use today. The personal computer, also known as the PC, is one of the most common types of computer due to its versatility and relatively low price. Laptops are generally very similar, although they may use lower-power or reduced size components, thus lower performance.
The computer case encloses most of the components of the system. It provides mechanical support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard, disk drives, and power supplies, and controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components. The case is also part of the system to control electromagnetic interference radiated by the computer, and protects internal parts from electrostatic discharge. Large tower cases
provide extra internal space for multiple disk drives or other peripherals and usually stand on the floor, while desktop cases provide less expansion room. All-in-one style designs from Apple, namely the iMac, and similar types, include a video display in the same case. Portable and laptop computers require cases that provide impact protection for the unit. A current development in laptop computers is a detachable keyboard, which allows the system to be configured as a touch-screen tablet. Hobbyists may decorate the cases with colored lights, paint, or other features, in an activity called case modding
Motherboard
 Introduction to the motherboard
The motherboard is the main component of a computer. It is a board with integrated circuitry (electric circuits collectively) that connects the other parts of the computer including the CPU, the RAM, the disk drives (CD, DVD, hard disk, or any others) as well as any peripherals connected via the ports or the expansion slots. But our primary emphasis is just what it does. Besides, motherboards do not all look alike. (Compare to image below.) Its a bit like lifting the hood on your car. You dont have to be a mechanic to know where to add windshield washer fluid. One of my goals is simply to take the mystery out of all that "stuff".

It would be useful to open an old desktop PC just to actually see the parts. While I dont recommend this with a laptop or hand-held device, the concepts are pretty much the same. That goes for servers, mainframes and supercomputers, as well.
We will talk about a few things you might do yourself to upgrade your computer in the last section of this module. Simply looking inside your computer can tell you if you have an open bay to add another hard disk and if you can add memory (or have to replace it).

A motherboard is an electronic boarding a computer which interconnects hardware devices attached to it - which is to say, all of the system hardware. At a minimum it includes one or more Central Processing Units (CPU), and the main processing activity of the computer takes place on it. However, other connected printed circuit boards may contain their own pre-processing or post-processing CPUs, to take some of the load off of the motherboard; these, together with other plug-in boards without CPUs, may be called "Daughter boards". It was called a "mother" board in relation to these. A PC motherboard generally has a series of slots, allowing daughter boards to be plugged in directly. Other connectors on the motherboard allow communication through cables with various peripheral devices, both inside and outside the computer case.
CPU
Alternately referred to as a processor, central processor, or microprocessor, the CPU (Pronounced sea-pea-you) is the Central Processing Unit of the computer. A computers CPU handles all instructions it receives from hardware and software running on the computer.
Note: Many new computer users may improperly call their computer and sometimes their monitor the CPU. When referring to your computer or monitor, it is proper to refer to them
as either the "computer" or "monitor" and not a CPU. The CPU is a chip inside the computer. The picture below is an example of what the top and bottom of an Intel Pentium processor may look. The processor is placed and secured into a compatible CPU socket found on the motherboard. Processors produce heat, so they are covered with a heat sink to keep them cool and running smoothly.

 Fixed Media
Data is stored by a computer using a variety of media. drives are found in virtually all older computers, due to their high capacity and low cost, but drives are faster and more power efficient, although currently more expensive than hard drives in terms of dollar per gigabyte, so are often found in personal computers built post-2007. Some systems may use a controller for greater performance or reliability.
Removable Media
To transfer data between computers, a drive or disc may be used. Their usefulness depends on being readable by other systems; the majority of machines have an optical disk drive, and virtually all have at least one USBport.
Chipset
 Definition - What does Chipset mean?
A chipset is a group of interdependent motherboard chips or integrated circuits that control the flow of data and instructions between the central processing units (CPU) or microprocessor and external devices. A chipset controls external buses, memory cache and some peripherals.
A CPU is unable to function without impeccable chipset timing. A chipset includes the circuit board layout/functionality and circuit mechanisms. Varieties include microprocessors and modem card chipsets. In addition, a CPU has several different chipsets that vary according to architecture. A chipset is specifically designed for a motherboard.
The chipset and motherboard must be compatible with the CPU to prevent system fail over. Most chipset drivers are manually updated and installed.

A chipset has two sections – Southbridge and Northbridge – with specific sets of functions that communicate between the CPU and external devices. The Southbridge, which is not directly connected to the CPU, is also known as the input/output controller hub. Southbridge handles the motherboards slower connections, including input/output (I/O) devices and computer peripherals like expansion slots and hard disk drives.
The Northbridge connects the Southbridge to the CPU and is commonly known as the memory controller hub.
The Northbridge handles a computers faster interaction requirements and controls communication between the CPU, RAM, ROM, the basic input/output system (BIOS); the accelerated graphics port (AGP) and the Southbridge chip.
The Northbridge links I/O signals directly to the CPU. The CPU uses the Northbridge frequency as a baseline for determining its operating frequency.
A chipset and device drivers are compatible when an operating system is initially installed. However, device drivers eventually become outdated due to subsequent hardware and

software installations. Outdated or incompatible device drivers create compatibility issues, lack of features and sub-par device performance.
 Input And Output Peripherals
Input and output devices are typically housed externally to the main computer chassis. The following are either standard or very common to many computer systems.
 Input
Devices allow the user to enter information into the system, or control its operation. Most personal computers have a mouse and keyboard, but laptop systems typically use a touchpad instead of a mouse. Other input devices include webcams, microphones, joysticks and image scanners.
 Output Device
Devices display information in a human readable form. Such devices could include printers, speakers, monitors or a Braille embosser.

Ports
Ports are used by a motherboard to interface with electronics both inside and outside of the computer. Integrated ports are those that are part of, or directly wired to, the motherboard. Internal integrated ports are used to connect devices inside the system unit. External ports may be connected to the motherboard directly (integrated) or by circuit boards that are inserted into slots on the motherboard. It is often possible to add new
external ports by inserting such a circuit board into an open slot. The external integrated ports are generally grouped together as shown below. Expansion card ports are arranged in a row of equal sized rectangular slots (see video and cards below). Wired Ethernet connection (Looks like a (bigger) telephone/modem jack. The cable itself is referred to by its category (e.g. CAT 5) and basic type, UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair).

USB
USB or Universal Serial Bus is a connectivity specification, currently at version 3 (V3). They are very common today, connecting flash drives and many peripherals. Modern desktop systems have should have 4-8 on the back of the computer and at least two on the front. USB is one of the most successful interconnect in computing history. V1 operates at 1.5 Mbps (low speed) or 12 Mbps (full speed), V2 (high speed) at 480 Mbps, and V3 (super speed) at up to 5Gbps. It can be found in over 2 billion PC and mobile devices. USB has strong consumer brand recognition and a reputation for ease-of-use. USB connectors are sometimes used to supply power, generally to recharge hand-held devices like a Smartphone.
Different USB connectors. From left to right: male Micro USB B-Type, proprietary (not USB), male Mini USB (5-pin) B-type, female A-type, male A-type, male B-type. Shown with a centimeter ruler. Female A-type connector (4th from left) is "upside down" to show the pins.
HDMI
The High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) replaces older analog media interfaces. It is available in "mini" and "micro" on many portable devices, allowing those smaller screen devices to be displayed on a larger screen, such as a TV.

 Modem
For many years the telephone, or voice band, modem (not shown above) was the primary means of connecting desktop and laptop PCs to the Internet. Modems have not gone away, as broadband connections are not available in all areas, but they are disappearing. A standard telephone modem uses your existing analog telephone line at speeds up 56 Kbps. The speed is limited by the quality of the phone line connection - extraneous noise lowers the actual through put.
Broadband connections (to be discussed in the section on networks) also use modems of a different type. They are still called modems because their essential function is the same - they convert digital signals to analog and modulate them on an analog medium when sending information, and reverse this process when receiving it. Hence, they MOdulate and DEModulate. Modem ports and connectors look a lot like Ethernet (RJ-45). A lot of networking was initially done with phone cables. Technically, they are called Category 3 UTP.

 Slots
On the typical desktop PC, a number of slots are provided on the motherboard (see image above) for attaching devices. One use of these slots is to expand or add to the ports available for external devices, as noted above. Graphics, audio and networking may be incorporated on the motherboard, but are often handled by (daughter) circuit boards added into slots. These are often pre-installed on your computer, but may be replaced (upgraded) as needed. Adding devices to laptop computers, after purchase, is problematic. Simply opening and closing the case can be a challenge and is not recommended for the novice, although manufactures usually provide fairly easy access to the RAM memory and hard disk. To allow for expansion through external devices, laptops often have an external slot (or port).
Graphics Card
Graphics cards are also called video cards or a video adapter. They are in all PCs, but may be integrated on the motherboard. Graphic cards generate output images that can be displayed on the monitor. While many graphics cards are built into the motherboard these days, enthusiasts will invest in stand-alone graphics cards with more powerful processing
capabilities. This allows for heavy image editing, or better rendering and frame rates in computer games. Graphics cards are designed to offload rendering from the CPU. Graphics cards are powered by the motherboard and require a PCI-X or PCIe slot to install.
Some cards require more power and thus will need a 6-8 pin connector that runs directly to the power supply. Graphics cards also include on-board memory for efficient rendering. Typical sizes include 128-1024MB of memory. Today, high end graphics cards have multiple core processors that are largely parallel to increase texture fill and process more 3D objects in real time.
VGA
Sound Card
A sound card, also referred to as an audio card, facilitates the input and output of audio signals to and from a computer under the control of computer programs. Sound cards for computers were uncommon until 1988, which left the single internal PC speaker as the only way early PC software could produce sound and music. Uses of a sound card include the audio components for multimedia applications such as games, video/audio editing software and music composition. Most computers today have sound capabilities built into the motherboard, while others require additional expansion cards.
The external ports are coded by industry standard.

Network Interface Card
A Network Interface Card (NIC) also called a network card, network adapter, or LAN Adapter is a piece of computer hardware designed to allow computers to communicate over a computer network. Used for remote communication via cable. Data is transmitted over a cable network. The NIC connects computers to the Internet and other devices, such as printers. Many modern motherboards have NICs built in by default. Most laptops also provide a wireless adapter or wireless network interface controller (WNIC). This device allows your laptop to communicate via a radio transceiver with a wireless (Wi-Fi) network. A WNIC can be added using a USB port or Express Card slot, often available on laptops.
Memory
Memory refers to the devices that are used to store data on an electronic computer. There are two basic types of memory: volatile (or temporary), and non-volatile (or permanent).
RAM or Primary Memory
RAM stands for Random Access Memory; it is the primary storage for the computer. All programs, including the operating system and any data they are using must be in RAM for the computer to access them. Whenever I hear the term, I think, "DAM, whyd they call it RAM?" It is called random because the computer can directly access any location in RAM (using its memory "address"), though we rarely have call to access memory randomly. Thus, Direct Access Memory would have been a better name. By comparison, a tape (video or audio) is a sequential medium. Accessing a particular note in a song is virtually impossible and requires scanning forward to find it. An audio editing program working on a song in RAM can and does directly access any point you want in the song. (Specifying it might be a problem, but consider cutting a section out to use as a ring tone. Once you specify the end points, the program goes directly to the indicated beginning and end.) RAM is volatile, or

temporary, storage. When the computer is booted, the operating system is loaded into RAM. Any applications you use are located in RAM, along with the data the application may use. A loss of power means that everything in RAM is lost. Data that you did not save (any changes you have made recently) are lost. To help protect you from this loss many applications automatically save a working copy to the (permanent) storage on the hard disk at regular intervals. (You can then recover most of your work.) The amount of RAM a system has is among the key specifications you will look at when considering to buy (or upgrade) a computer system. Without sufficient RAM, the computer will work poorly, or not all.
RAM is typically measured in gigabytes (GB), and the more you have (within reason), the better your system is likely to work (and the more it will cost).
Speed And Types Of RAM
Most computers use dynamic RAM (as opposed to the more expensive, but faster static RAM) for main memory in the computer. Currently, computers tend to use DDR-1,DDR-2 or DDR-3RAM chips. All are a type of synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM) with each
generation becoming progressively faster. Obviously, for the best performance, you want DDR-3. All forms of RAM are fast compared to disk drives and other mass storage devices, outperforming them by a factor of 1,000 times or more. (Solid State Drives are a special case discussed below.) RAM chips are manufactured as circuit boards (dual in-line memory modules) that are slotted into the motherboard.
All these are type of Memory RAM.

Cache
Cache Memory is very similar to RAM. It is faster, but more expensive, than RAM, so it is generally available in much smaller size than main memory. You will recall that level 1 cache is located in the CPU. Other levels are generally larger than their predecessor and located near the CPU. Cache memory is volatile, or temporary, storage - the intention is for it to be very temporary storage.
Virtual Memory
Both the operating system and all of your applications (along with their data) need to be in RAM for you to use them. What happens when RAM fills up? Or, a related problem, there isnt a big enough chunk of RAM available to fit an entire application into? Memory solves these problems using a special (swap or page) file on the hard disk. Pieces (called a page) of an application that is not currently being used can be moved temporarily to the swap file, making more room available in physical RAM. When that part of the program is needed, it is
taken from the file and placed back into RAM, possibly displacing some other page from RAM. The two pages are said to have been "swapped".
This scheme allows the computer to pretend that it has much more RAM than it actually does, at a significant performance cost. RAM is about 1,000 times faster than the hard disk, so the process of swapping pages slows the system down. In the worst case, called thrashing, the computer is spending an inordinate amount of its time simply moving pages back and forth from RAM to the swap file. The only practical remedy for this situation is to add additional physical RAM - or quit using so many apps at the same time.
ROM
ROM refers to a Read Only Memory chip that cannot be written on or erased by the computer user without taking special action. ROM is non-volatile, so contents are not lost when power to the computer is no longer available. Initially, ROM was truly read only (hence the name). Any program it stored was "hard wired" at the time of manufacture. This evolved into erasable programmable ROM (EPROM) chips, as shown at right. These devices allowed (at least some amount of) the programming to be erased and changed or

"flashed". Eventually, this technology evolved into the portable flash drives that are so ubiquitous today and the new solid state drives.
The ROM chip contains all of the information needed to start the computer. The BIOS (or Basic Input/output System) checks to make sure all the necessary hardware is attached and working. It then begins loading the operating system found on the hard disk, in a special location, into RAM. This is often done in two steps, with the initial phase called the bootstrap. Once the operating system is fully loaded into RAM, control is turned over to the OS to complete the boot process. The final steps in booting include starting necessary system utilities, programs you have scheduled to be loaded at boot time, and configuring the applications to run on your system. This boot process, which starts at the flip of a switch, has a mechanical analogy in the (many different) Rube Goldberg machine(s). This step from hardware, i.e. a big paperweight, to an operating computer is the real "magic" of computing.

    <string name="capacitor">
        Capacitors are often referenced in many troubleshooting guides around the Internet; however, you’ll hear about them most when it comes to the motherboard. Even though we see capacitors referenced quite a bit, we might not know what they are our even what they do.
Follow along below, and we’ll show you why they’re so important.

WHAT ARE CAPACITORS?
In layman’s terms, a capacitor is a tiny electrical component soldered to the motherboard. Capacitors perform a couple of different functions. First, a capacitor conditions DC voltage to other components (e.g. the video card, hard drive, sound card etc.) as a way to provide a steady stream of power. Finally, a capacitor can also hold or store an electric charge to be discharged at a later time, such as in the case of a camera flash.
WHAT’S ON THE INSIDE?
What you see on the motherboard is a ceramic and plastic container. On the inside of that is usually two or a set of two conductive plates with a thin insulator between them. And then, you, of course, have that packaged inside the fore mentioned container for protection.
TECH JUNKIE TV
When a capacitor receives a direct current, a positive charge will build up on one end of the plates while a negative charge builds up on the other plate. This positive and negative charge is stored in the capacitor until it’s discharged.
WHAT ARE THEY USED FOR?
So, that’s what capacitors are, but what do they do? As we already mentioned, one of the functions of a capacitor is that it conditions power to be sent to other components. The reason for this is that, while components rely on electricity to run, they’re also very sensitive

to swings in voltage. For instance, a voltage surge or spike could completely fry all of the components within your PC. After spending a good amount of money on hardware, that’s not something you really want. Unfortunately, voltage amounts change all the time — they aren’t constant. So, how do you stop it from frying your components? With a capacitor.
A capacitor is placed in line to your component and absorbs spikes in power, creating a constant steady stream of the electricity or voltage needed to power your component. And while capacitors can handle some spikes in voltage, it’s always good to have a UPS or surge protector as a first line of defense. There are, of course, other types of capacitors as well. Using the example of a flash camera, your typical battery isn’t going to be capable of producing the sheer amount of electrons needed to create the flash. That’s why there’s a photo flash capacitor built into the camera. In as simple terms as possible, it’s a electrolytic capacitor that charges up from the battery, holding that charge, and then discharging it when it has enough charge) to create the light energy for the flash. And so, a capacitor is able to hold a charge until it is to be discharged at a later time. Unfortunately, like many things, capacitors are subject to wear and tear.
That said, they can blow or bulge. When a capacitor fails, your component isn’t going to work anymore. In extreme scenarios, you might see the casing almost entirely melted. But, in more common instances, you’ll see the vents bulging (top of the capacitor).
CAN THEY BE REPAIRED?
Capacitors can’t be repaired — they have to be replaced. There’s no way around that. All you need is the (correct) capacitor replacement and tools to solder it back onto the motherboard. However, it’s not recommended that you do this if you don’t know what you’re doing or have never used the tools to solder a capacitor back on.
Instead, most people opt for sending the motherboard to a repair facility or even just go ahead buy a brand new one. In other words, if you haven’t done this yourself before, it’s wise to leave it alone. You don’t want to risk hurting yourself and potentially damage additional parts of the motherboard.

CLOSING
And that’s how capacitors work! At first, they may seem like unimpressive little components scattered around your motherboard that don’t mean anything. However, they’re an integral part to how the motherboard and other components receive power.

 Disassembling the computer system
 Detach the power cable:
The disassembling of the computer system starts with externally connected device detachment. Make sure the computer system is turned off, if not then successfully shut down the system and then start detaching the external devices from the computer system. It includes removing the power cable from electricity switch board, and then removes the cable from SMPS (switch mode power supply) from the back of the CPU Cabinet. Do not start the disassembling without detaching the power cable from the computer system. Now remove the remaining external devices like keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer or scanner from the back of CPU cabinet.
Remove the Cover:
The standard way of removing tower cases used to be to undo the screws on the back of the case, slide the cover back about an inch and lift it off. The screw drivers as per the type of screw are required to do the task.

 Remove the adapter cards:
Make sure if the card has any cables or wires that might be attached and decide if it would be easier to remove them before or after you remove the card. Remove the screw if any that holds the card in place. Grab the card by its edges, front and back, and gently rock it length wise to release it.
 Remove the drives:
Removing drives is easier. There can be possibly three types of drives present in your computer system, Hard disk drive, CD/DVD/Blue-ray drives, floppy disk drives (almost absolute now a day). They usually have a power connector and a data cable attached from the device to a controller card or a connector on the motherboard. CD/DVD/Blue Ray drive may have an analog cable connected to the sound card for direct audio output. The power may be attached using one of two connectors, a Molex connector or a Berg connector for the drive. The Molex connector may require to be wiggled slightly from side to side and
apply gentle pressure outwards. The Berg connector may just pull out or it may have a small tab which has to be lifted with a screwdriver.
Now pull data cables off from the drive as well as motherboard connector. The hard disk drive and CD/DVD drives have two types of data cables. IDE and SATA cables. The IDE cables need better care while being removed as it may cause the damage to drive connector pins. Gently wiggle the cable sideways and remove it. The SATA cables can be removed easily by pressing the tab and pulling the connector straight back. Now remove the screws and slide the drive out the back of the bay.
 Remove the memory module:
Memory modules are mounted on the motherboard as the chips that can be damaged by manual force if applied improperly. Be careful and handle the chip only by the edges. SIMMs and DIMMs are removed in a different way:

 SIMM - gently push back the metal tabs while holding the SIMM chips in the socket. Tilt the SIMM chip away from the tabs until a 45% angle. It will now lift out of the socket. Put SIMM in a safe place.
 DIMM- There is plastic tabs on the end of the DIMM sockets. Press the tabs down and away from the socket. The DIMM will lift slightly. Now grab it by the edges and place it safely. Do not let the chips get dust at all.
Remove processor

Remove the motherboard | Source
Remove the power supply:
The power supply is attached into tower cabinet at the top back end of the tower. Make sure the power connector is detached from the switchboard. Start removing the power connector connected to motherboard including CPU fan power connector, cabinet fan, the front panel of cabinet power buttons and all the remaining drives if not detached yet. Now remove the screws of SMPS from the back of the cabinet and the SMPS can be detached from the tower cabinet.
Remove the motherboard:
Before removing all the connectors from the motherboard, make sure u memorize the connectors for assembling the computer if required, as that may require connecting the connectors at its place. Remove the screws from the back of the motherboard and you will be able to detach it from the cabinet. Now remove the CPU fan from the motherboard. The heat sink will be visible now which can be removed by the pulling the tab upward. Finally, the processor is visible now, which can be removed by the plastic tab which can be pulled back one stretching it side way.

Assembling the computer system
The assembling of the computer system is exactly the opposite of disassembling operation. Before starting assembling the computer system, make sure you have the screws and a screw driver for those. The first step for assembling the computer system starts with mounting the processor on the processor socket of the motherboard. To mount the process, you dont need to apply any force. The special ZIF (zero insertion force) sockets are usually used to prevent any damage to the processor pins. Once the processor is mounted, the heat sink will be attached on top of the processor. The CPU fan is also attached on top of the heat sink. Now the motherboard is to be fixed vertically in the tower case and the screws are fixed from behind of the motherboard. Now line up the power supply at the top back end of the cabinet and screw it. The power connectors for motherboard power supply and CPU fan power supply are to be connected. If the cabinet cooling FAN is required then it is to be screwed at the back end grill of the cabinet and its power connector is to be connected from SMPS.
Install the CD/DVD drives at the top front end of the cabinet and screw it. Install the Hard disk drive and floppy disk drive below CD/DVD drive and screw it. Make sure once screwed
there is no vibration in either of the CD/DVD, Hard disk or Floppy disk drives. Now select the appropriate data cable and connect one end of the cable to its drive socket and another end at its appropriate connector on the motherboard. For SATA hard disk drive or CD/DVD drives use SATA cable and its power cable, else use IDE data cable. Do the proper jumper settings as per the usage requirement. It is time now to mount the memory modules on the motherboard by aligning the RAM to its socket on the motherboard and press it downward. Make sure the side tab is fixed into the RAM notch. If not, you may still have to press a bit.
Install the internal cards to its socket and attach the cables or power cable to it. The selection of right socket or slot is required as per the type of socket. Cover the tower by placing it and pressing towards front side and screw it. Connect the external devices with CPU at its appropriate socket. It includes mouse and keyboard at PS2 or USB connectors. Monitor at the video output socket. Connect the power cable to the back of tower in SMPS. Plug in the power cable to the electric board.

         Power Supply
 Definition - What does Power Supply mean?
A power supply is a component that supplies power to at least one electric load. Typically, it converts one type of electrical power to another, but it may also convert different form of energy – such as solar, mechanical, or chemical - into electrical energy.
A power supply provides components with electric power. The term usually pertains to devices integrated within the component being powered.
For example, computer power supplies convert AC current to DC current and are generally located at the rear of the computer case, along with at least one fan. A power supply is also known as a power supply unit, power brick or power adapter.

Techopedia explains Power Supply Most computer power supplies also have an input voltage switch, which can be set to 110v/115v or 220v/240v, depending on the geographic location. This switch position is crucial because of the different power voltages supplied by power outlets in different countries. Most computers now use a switched-mode power supply, which changes AC current to DC voltage. This voltage can be switched on and off
electronically. A switched- mode power supply can also shut itself down before damage is done when a short is detected. Most computer power supplies include a number of switched-mode supplies, which operate independently by producing a single voltage. These are linked together, so that they shut down as a group in case of a computer fault.

    <string name="upgrade_or_replace">
        The decision of whether to upgrade your existing system or replace it depends on a lot of factors, not the least of which is your bank account. In years past, when a typical home desktop PC cost $5,000 (or more), upgrading was something you planned for. The most common upgrades by far were
Adding a new device (perhaps a scanner),
Adding or replacing RAM, and
Adding a second hard disk drive.
Another thing to consider is your goal in upgrading. For any system, new or old, you should consider what you plan to use it for. Assess existing equipment to see if it meets your needs

now and new equipment to ensure that it will meet them for at least a couple of years. Keep in mind that each year processors are faster (Moores law), RAM is cheaper, new programs become available (and they usually require more RAM), and disk drives are bigger, faster and cheaper. When speed is an issue with your current system, you should first go through the process of cleaning it up using various system utilities. We will talk about this in a later module.

 Adding a device
Of course, I cant predict what you might not have and want, so I will pick some common items.

 Adding a second monitor
Screen space is precious, but is a second screen a luxury? You wont think so when you are working on one screen while referring to data on the other! Unfortunately, monitors are expensive. This makes the most sense if you just bought a new system with a monitor and still have the "old" one. Watch the three linked videos or search for your own.

This makes the most sense if you just bought a new system with a monitor and still have the "old" one. Watch the three linked videos or search for your own.
USB Ports
You can buy expansion cards for this, but it usually makes more sense to purchase a (Powered) "USB hub". This device will plug into a USB port and provide three or more new ports. It is important to know that USB provides power, as well as data transfer, and many devices use that power (sometime just to charge batteries). Although they are inexpensive, a passive hub has to split the existing power among all of the new ports and may not work for some charging needs.
Adding RAM
Adding RAM is easy. Check your motherboard first to see if you have available slots. Your system manual can tell you what kind of memory to buy (you usually dont have a choice) and if you need to install the module(s) in pairs. The video is about 5 years old, so the amounts of RAM recommended are quite out of date. In early 2011, even a low end desktop comes with 4GB of RAM. Current laptops and desktops range up to 12 GB and 32 GB, respectively.

Current laptops and desktops range up to 12 GB and 32 GB, respectively.

Grounding: Before mucking about inside the computer, where common sense and reasonable care are usually sufficient to prevent damage, you do have to ground yourself. Grounding refers to getting rid of any static charge you might have built up in your body. This is the same charge that "zaps" you after dragging your feet across a carpet.
You remove the charge essentially the same way - by touching a pipe or metal faucet, for example. IT technicians wear a grounding strap on their wrist to continually discharge any static electricity.
Adding A Hard Disk
In the past, it seemed that you never had enough disk space. With videos and music, this may still be true. Even if not, you can add a second hard disk to make backing up your files easy. Note that off-site backup is still recommended since a fire, or a virus, is likely to destroy both hard disks at the same time. A portable disk drive also allows you to easily backup your data.
The latest option is cloud storage, but it some with its own risks.
 Graphics Card
Unless your graphics card is integrated onto the motherboard, you will probably be replacing the card you now have. (Multiple cards are useful for multiple screens.) This update is primarily used by gamers.
Upgrading Sound Card
This is also something you will probably only do if you are a gamer. Nevertheless.
 Replacing The CPU
Most people do not upgrade the CPU. But, as with some of the above, there are those looking for lots more from their machine then others. (The text guide is four years old, but still relevant.)

Installing A Motherboard
You came pretty close to this when replacing the CPU, as you have to take the motherboard out to do so. The probable reasons for replacing the motherboard is to get the new chip set that comes with it, allowing you to install a CPU you want.
Of course, the number of slots of various types may also be different. The upgrades listed above have become progressively more difficult. Replacing the motherboard is equivalent to building your own PC.
(There are lots of videos for that.) I dont recommend this upgrade for most people.
(There are lots of videos for that.) I dont recommend this upgrade for most people.
 Power
The more equipment you add, the more power you will need. Eventually, you will exceed what the original power supply is capable of furnishing.
 Wrap-Up
No one expects you to become an IT technician and if you were really comfortable doing any of these upgrades, you probably wouldnt be taking the class. However, a recurring theme has been that the computer is fairly modular and that most upgrades are pretty easy. Even if you never take the cover off the computer yourself, having seen this, you will be better prepared to assist a friend or to know what kinds of upgrades are available. At the very least, you will have some sense of what it should cost if you have to hire someone to do it for you.

Should the upgrade you are interested in be missing... just note the kinds of titles for the videos and guides above. Google will quickly find what you need. (Well, you may have to watch a lot of bad videos before you find the good one. Just enjoy the art form of self-made how-to videos.)The ease (or difficulty) of upgrading or replacement is an issue to consider. Laptops and hand-held devices can be difficult or impossible to upgrade, which is why all of the videos and guides were about desktop units. The video to the right shows how to upgrade RAM and the hard disk in a Mac and IBM laptop all in one session. Look up how to upgrade your model before attempting it, and note that replacing the hard drive means

starting from nothing and re-installing everything. The second video talks about that, although it was based on the premise of a virus or something having wiped out the disk.

    <!--proficiency of software-->
    <string name="device_driver">
        A device driver is a specific type of computer software developed to allow interaction with hardware devices. Typically this constitutes an interface for communicating with the device, through the specific computer bus or communications subsystem that the hardware is connected to, providing commands to and/or receiving data from the device, and on the other end, the requisite interfaces to the operating system and software applications. It is a specialized hardware-dependent computer program which is also operating system specific that enables another program, typically an operating system or applications software package or computer program running under the operating system kernel, to interact
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

transparently with a hardware device, and usually provides the requisite interrupt handling necessary for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interfacing needs.
The key design goal of device drivers is abstraction. Every model of hardware (even within the same class of device) is different. Newer models also are released by manufacturers that provide more reliable or better performance and these newer models are often controlled differently. Computers and their operating systems cannot be expected to know how to control every device, both now and in the future. To solve this problem, operating systems essentially dictate how every type of device should be controlled. The function of the device driver is then to translate these operating system mandated function calls into device specific calls.
In theory a new device, which is controlled in a new manner, should function correctly if a suitable driver is available. This new driver ensures that the device appears to operate as usual from the operating systems point of view.
Under versions of Windows before Vista and versions of Linux before 2.6, all driver execution was co-operative, meaning that if a driver entered an infinite loop it would freeze the system. More recent revisions of these operating systems incorporate kernel preemption, where the kernel interrupts the driver to give it tasks, and then separates itself from the process until it receives a response from the device driver, or gives it more tasks to do.

        ICT Technician – ICTTech, Who is it for?
ICT Technicians or practitioners work in areas such as ICT hardware, software or system installation, operation, maintenance, incident/change/problem management, administration, security, fault diagnosis and fixing. They typically work in a range of jobs that involve supporting or facilitating the use of ICT equipment and applications by others and will be working in all fields of ICT, for example in data centres or on pcs or out in the field diagnosing and solving faults.
ICT Technicians can demonstrate underpinning knowledge and competence in the following: Supporting or enabling the use of ICT equipment and applications by others Selecting and using appropriate ICT resources, techniques, configurations, procedures and methods installing, operating, supporting or maintaining ICT systems Protecting ICT systems from intrusion, damage or data loss being personally responsible for ICT systems.
Why become an ICT Technician? Eg. Sinead Watts MITP ICTTech
Professional registration sets an ICT Technician (ICTTech) apart from technicians who are not registered. In a fast-moving world of technologies and qualifications, it establishes proven competence and demonstrates commitment to professional standards as well as to life-long learning. Hence, whether specified in job advertisements or not, professional registration as a professional ICT Technician gives you an edge.

        Hacktivism
Hacktivism is the use of (illegal) hacking techniques for an activist cause. Hacktivism could be further defined as "the non-violent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of political ends". These tools include web site defacements, redirects, denial-of-service attacks, information theft, virtual sit-ins, and virtual sabotage. Like any form of activism, doing something for (what you consider to be) a good cause does not make it legal or right.

Viruses  Worms
The best-known types of malware, viruses and worms, are known for the manner in which they spread, rather than any other particular behavior. The term computer virus is used for a program that has infected some executable software and, when run, causes the virus to spread to other executable.
Viruses may also perform other actions, like creating a backdoor for later use, damaging files, or even damaging equipment. On the other hand, a worm is a program that actively transmits itself over a network to infect other computers. Worms may also take malicious actions.
These definitions lead to the observation that a virus requires user intervention to spread, whereas a worm spreads itself automatically. Using this distinction, infections transmitted by email or Microsoft Word documents, which rely on the recipient opening a file or email to infect the system, would be classified as viruses rather than worms.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Trojans
In broad terms, a Trojan horse is any program that invites the user to run it, concealing a harmful or malicious payload. The payload may take effect immediately and can lead to many undesirable effects, such as deleting the users files or further installing malicious or undesirable software. Trojan horses known as droppers are used to start off a worm outbreak, by "injecting" the worm into users local networks.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

One of the most common ways that spyware is distributed is as a Trojan horse, bundled with a piece of desirable software that the user downloads from the Internet. When the user installs the software, the spyware is installed alongside. Spyware authors who attempt to act in a legal fashion may include an end-user license agreement that states the behavior of the spyware in loose terms, which the users are unlikely to read or understand.
Rootkits
Originally, a rootkit was a set of tools installed by a human attacker on a UNIX system, allowing the attacker to gain administrator (root) access. Today, the term rootkit is used more generally for concealment routines in a malicious program. Once a malicious program is installed on a system, it is essential that it stays concealed, to avoid detection and disinfection. The same is true when a human attacker breaks into a computer directly. Techniques known as rootkits allow this concealment, by modifying the hosts operating system so that the malware is hidden from the user. Rootkits can prevent a malicious process from being visible in the systems list of processes, or keep its files from being read.
In an attempt to keep the user from stopping a malicious process, another is sometimes installed to monitor it. When the process is stopped (killed), another is immediately created. Modern malware starts a number of processes that monitor and restore one another as needed. In the event that a user running Microsoft Windows is infected with such malware (if they wish to manually stop it), they could use Task Managers processes tab to find the main process (the one that spawned the "resurrector process (es)"),
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

and use the end process tree function, which would kill not only the main process, but the "resurrector(s)" as well, since they were started by the main process. Some malware programs use other techniques, such as naming the infected file similar to a legitimate or trustworthy file (expl0rer.exe VS explorer.exe) to avoid detection in the process list.
 Backdoors
A backdoor is a method of bypassing normal authentication procedures. Once a system has been compromised (by one of the above methods, or in some other way), one or more backdoors may be installed in order to allow easier access in the future. Backdoors may also be installed prior to malicious software, to allow attackers entry.
 Spyware
Spyware is a type of malicious software that can be installed on computers, and which collects small pieces of information about users without their knowledge. The presence of spyware is typically hidden from the user, and can be difficult to detect. Typically, spyware is secretly installed on the users personal computer. While the term spyware suggests software that secretly monitors the users computing, the functions of spyware extend well beyond simple monitoring. Spyware programs can collect various types of personal
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

information, such as Internet surfing habits and sites that have been visited, but can also interfere with user control of the computer in other ways, such as installing additional software and redirecting Web browser activity. Spyware is known to change computer settings, resulting in slow connection speeds, different home pages, and/or loss of Internet connection or functionality of other programs. In an attempt to increase the understanding of spyware, a more formal classification of its included software types is provided by the term privacy-invasive software.
Classification of code as spyware (or sometimes browser cookies as "tracking" cookies) can be controversial. Often the software is installed by the user knowing that some amount of monitoring will take place. Users generally agree to this activity to get free software and it is often associated with music and video sharing. Some such software allows the user to turn off the monitoring, assuming they are aware of it and can find instructions for disabling it. Anti-spyware is usually part of anti-virus programs; scan using at least two different AV packages. Spybot Search and Destroy is a good freeware program for looking for spyware.
Loggers
Keystroke logging (often called key logging) is the action of tracking (or logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically in a covert manner so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. There are numerous key logging methods, ranging from hardware and software-based approaches to electromagnetic and acoustic analysis.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Key logging is often used by law enforcement, parents, and jealous or suspicious spouses (lovers). The most common use, however, is in the workplace, where your employer is monitoring your use of the computer. Unfortunately, all of these activities are legal.

POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

 Adware
Adware, or advertising-supported software, is any software package which automatically plays, displays, or downloads advertisements to a computer. These advertisements can be in the form of a pop-up. The object of the Adware is to generate revenue for its author. Adware, by itself, is harmless; however, some adware may come with integrated spyware such as key loggers and other privacy-invasive software.
Advertising functions are integrated into or bundled with the software, which is often designed to note what Internet sites the user visits and to present advertising pertinent to the types of goods or services featured there - making it related to spyware.
Adware is usually seen by the developer as a way to recover development costs, and in some cases it may allow the software to be provided to the user free of charge or at a reduced price. The income derived from presenting advertisements to the user may allow or motivate the developer to continue to develop, maintain and upgrade the software product. Conversely, the advertisements may be seen by the user as interruptions or annoyances or as distractions from the task at hand.
Some adware is also shareware, and so the word may be used as a term of distinction to differentiate between types of shareware software. What differentiates adware from other shareware is that it is primarily advertising-supported, like many free Smartphone apps. Users may also be given the option to
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

pay for a "registered" or "licensed" copy to do away with the advertisements. Radio offers both a free version (with ads) and a paid subscription (without ads).
There is a group of software (Alexa toolbar, Google toolbar, Eclipse data usage collector, etc.) that sends data to a central server about which pages have been visited or which features of the software have been used. However they differ from "classic" malware because these tools only send data with the users approval. The user may opt in to share the data in exchange for additional features and services or (in case of Eclipse) as a form of voluntary support for the project.
Some security tools report such loggers as malware while others do not. The status of this group is questionable.
Some tools like PDF Creator are more on the boundary than others because opting out has been made more complex than it could be (during the installation, the user needs to uncheck two check boxes rather than one). However, PDF Creator is only sometimes mentioned as malware and is still subject of discussions.

It seems appropriate after discussing malware to talk about protecting your system and keeping it running well. In the workplace, the IT department will handle this - of course, in a small business, you may be the IT department. For hand-held devices, you generally dont have access to all the tools discussed here. However, much of this applies as much to Smartphone as to your desktop PC or laptop. For these devices, you are the system administrator.

 What if you have a Mac?
It may surprise those in the Windows world to hear it, but there is disagreement about whether it is worth it to worry about malware in the Mac world. In fact, most malware has been generated for the far more popular Windows world. And, the lack of control over applications for Windows has encouraged this (and the many more applications than are available for Macs). Some also think there are inherently fewer bugs (vulnerabilities) to exploit in the Mac. However, currently there is a great deal of news being generated by malware written for the Mac. (I believe Firewalls, anti-virus and anti-spyware should be used on all computer systems, including your Smartphone.) As malware and general PC administration is the focus here, we will revisit some of these issues later for more specific topics, like networks and the Internet.

        Malware
Malware, short for malicious software, consists of programming (code, scripts, active content, and other software) designed to damage or disable the system or data, disrupt or deny operation, gather information that leads to loss of privacy or exploitation, gain unauthorized access to system resources, and other abusive behavior. The expression is a general term used by computer professionals to mean a variety of forms of hostile, intrusive, or annoying software or program code.
Malware is not the same as defective software - software that has a legitimate purpose but contains harmful bugs or programming errors. Since the result may be the same, it should be clear that intent is considered important although this is a historically vague rule.
What Is Its Purpose?
Categorizing malware by its purpose - the intent of the author - can be difficult or impossible. The following categories just give us a way to think about malware. Others might choose different categories, place a particular piece of malware in a different category, and some malware might reasonably fit into multiple categories.

Pranks
Many early infectious programs, including a number of MS-DOS viruses, were written as experiments or pranks. They were generally intended to be harmless or merely annoying, rather than to cause serious damage to computer systems. In some cases, the perpetrator did not realize how much harm his or her creations would do. Young programmers learning about viruses and their techniques wrote them simply for practice, or to see how far they could spread. As late as 1999, widespread viruses such as the Melissa virus appear to have been written chiefly as a prank. Many believe the infamous Morris Worm, that shut down a large part of the Internet in 1988 and started a new era in network security, was a prank or experiment gone wrong - others are not so sure it belongs in this category. In any case, none of these efforts had any "legitimate purpose" for you, the user/manager/owner of the system "attacked".
Intentionally Harmful
Hostile intent related to vandalism can be found in programs designed to cause harm or data loss. Many DOS viruses, and the Windows Explore Zipworm, were designed to destroy files on a hard disk, or to corrupt the file system by writing invalid data to them. Network-born worms, such as the 2001 Code Redworm, fall into the same category. Sometimes a worm is designed to vandalize web pages, like the online equivalent to graffiti tagging, with the authors alias or affinity group appearing everywhere the worm goes. (Note that the basic purpose of most web pages is to provide information, to communicate, so interfering with that goal is generally harmful.)

Profit
Since the rise of widespread broadband Internet access, some malicious software has been designed for a profit, like forced advertising, for example. (Some forced advertising causes your browser to redirect you to an advertising page or displays pop-ups.) Since 2003, the majority of widespread viruses and worms have been designed to take control of users computers for black-market exploitation. Infected "zombie computers" are used to send email spam, to host contraband data such as child pornography, or to engage in distributed denial-of-service attacks as a form of extortion.
The latest versions seems to be claiming that you have a virus and "offering" you a solution or claiming that you have violated a law and need to send money (by credit card) to avoid prosecution. (The latter is often related to pornography and usually occurs when you are visiting such a site, which hints at an avoidance strategy.) In the worst case, your data is encrypted and held hostage until you pay (Ransom ware).
In each case, your best bet is to not click on anything on the web page or any pop-ups. Instead, start your task manager or system monitor and delete or kill the process. Sort the processes by name; find every instance of your browser application and "force stop" them all. If necessary, reboot your computer. If necessary use a "hard reboot" - hold the power button in for ten seconds. If none of those are successful, its time to contact your IT department. The sidebar explaining process appeared in the last module.

Indirect Profit
Another strictly for-profit category of malware has emerged in spyware - programs designed to monitor users web browsing or other activity, display unsolicited advertisements, or redirect affiliate marketing revenues to the spyware creator. Spyware programs do not generally spread like viruses; they are, in general, installed by exploiting security holes or are packaged with user-installed software, such as peer-to-peer music sharing applications. Sometimes, the spyware is loaded unknowingly by the user in response to a web page pop-up. Probably the easiest step you can take to minimize attacks of all sorts is to use a "non-privileged" user account on a day-to-day basis.

    <string name="memory_management">
        Among other things, a multiprogramming operating system kernel must be responsible for managing all system memory which is currently in use by programs. This ensures that a program does not interfere with memory already in use by another program. Since programs time share, each program must have independent access to memory.
Cooperative memory management, used by many early operating systems, assumes that all programs make voluntary use of the kernels memory manager, and do not exceed their allocated memory. This system of memory management is almost never seen any more, since programs often contain bugs which can cause them to exceed their allocated memory. If a program fails, it may cause memory used by one or more other programs to be affected or overwritten. Malicious programs or viruses may purposefully alter another programs memory, or may affect the operation of the operating system itself. With cooperative memory management, it takes only one misbehaved program to crash the system.
Memory protection enables the kernel to limit a process access to the computers memory. Various methods of memory protection exist, including memory segmentation and paging. All methods require some level of hardware support (such as the 80286MMU), which doesnt exist in all computers.
In both segmentation and paging, certain protected mode registers specify to the CPU what memory address it should allow a running program to access. Attempts to access other addresses trigger an interrupt which cause the CPU to re-enter supervisor mode, placing the kernel in charge. This is called a
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

segmentation violation or Seg-V for short and since it is both difficult to assign a meaningful result to such an operation, and because it is usually a sign of a misbehaving program, the kernel generally resorts to terminating the offending program, and reports the error.
Windows versions 3.1 through ME had some level of memory protection, but programs could easily circumvent the need to use it. A general protection fault would be produced, indicating a segmentation violation had occurred; however, the system would often crash anyway.
 Virtual Memory
The use of virtual memory addressing (such as paging or segmentation) means that the kernel can choose what memory each program may use at any given time, allowing the operating system to use the same memory locations for multiple tasks. If a program tries to access memory that isnt in its current range of accessible memory, but nonetheless has been allocated to it, the kernel is interrupted in the same way as it would if the program were to exceed its allocated memory. (See section on memory management.) Under UNIX this kind of interrupt is referred to as a page fault.
When the kernel detects a page fault it generally adjusts the virtual memory range of the program which triggered it, granting it access to the memory requested. This gives the kernel discretionary power over where a particular applications memory is stored, or even whether or not it has actually been allocated yet.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

In modern operating systems, memory which is accessed less frequently can be temporarily stored on disk or other media to make that space available for use by other programs. This is called swapping, as an area of memory can be used by multiple programs, and what that memory area contains can be swapped or exchanged on demand. “Virtual memory" provides the programmer or the user with the perception that there is a much larger amount of RAM in the computer than is really there.

Definition - What does Microsoft Office mean?
Microsoft Office is a suite of desktop productivity applications that is designed specifically to be used for office or business use. It is a proprietary product of Microsoft Corporation and was first released in 1990. Microsoft Office is available in 35 different languages and is supported by Windows, Mac and most Linux variants. It mainly consists of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, OneNote, Outlook and Publisher applications.

    <string name="multitasking">
        Multitasking refers to the running of multiple independent computer programs on the same computer; giving the appearance that it is performing the tasks at the same time. Since most computers can do at most one or two things at one time, this is generally done via time-sharing, which means that each program uses a share of the computers time to execute.
An operating system kernel contains a scheduling program which determines how much time each process spends executing, and in which order execution control should be passed to programs. Control is passed to a process by the kernel, which allows the program access to the CPU and memory. Later, control is returned to the kernel through some mechanism, so that another program may be allowed to use the CPU. This so-called passing of control between the kernel and applications is called a context switch.
An early model which governed the allocation of time to programs was called cooperative multitasking. In this model, when control is passed to a program by the kernel, it may execute for as long as it wants before explicitly returning control to the kernel. This means that a malicious or malfunctioning program may not only prevent any other programs from using the CPU, but it can hang the entire system if it enters a loop. Modern operating systems extend the concepts of application preemption to device drivers and kernel code, so that the operating system has preemptive control over internal run-times as well.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

The philosophy governing preemptive multitasking is that of ensuring that all programs are given regular time on the CPU. This implies that all programs must be limited in how much time they are allowed to spend on the CPU without being interrupted. To accomplish this, modern operating system kernels make use of a timed interrupt. A protected mode timer is set by the kernel which triggers a return to supervisor mode after the specified time has elapsed.
On many single user operating systems cooperative multitasking is perfectly adequate, as home computers generally run a small number of well tested programs. The AmigaOS is an exception, having preemptive multitasking from its very first version. Windows NT was the first version of Microsoft Windows which enforced preemptive multitasking, but it didnt reach the home user market until Windows XP(since Windows NT was targeted at professionals).
 Disk Access And File Systems
Access to data stored on disks is a central feature of all operating systems. Computers store data on disks using files, which are structured in specific ways in order to allow for faster access, higher reliability, and to make better use of the drives available space. The specific way in which files are stored on a disk is called a file system, and enables files to have names and attributes. It also allows them to be stored in a hierarchy of directories or folders arranged in a directory tree.
Early operating systems generally supported a single type of disk drive and only one kind of file system. Early file systems were limited in their capacity, speed, and in the kinds of file names and directory
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

structures they could use. These limitations often reflected limitations in the operating systems they were designed for, making it very difficult for an operating system to support more than one file system.
While many simpler operating systems support a limited range of options for accessing storage systems, operating systems like UNIX and Linux support a technology known as a virtual file system or VFS. An operating system such as UNIX supports a wide array of storage devices, regardless of their design or file systems, allowing them to be accessed through a common application programming interface (API). This makes it unnecessary for programs to have any knowledge about the device they are accessing. A VFS allows the operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them, through the use of specific device drivers and file system drivers.
A connected storage device, such as a hard drive, is accessed through a device driver. The device driver understands the specific language of the drive and is able to translate that language into a standard language used by the operating system to access all disk drives. On UNIX, this is the language of block devices.
When the kernel has an appropriate device driver in place, it can then access the contents of the disk drive in raw format, which may contain one or more file systems. A file system driver is used to translate the commands used to access each specific file system into a standard set of commands that the operating system can use to talk to all file systems. Programs can then deal with these files systems on the basis of filenames, and directories/folders, contained within a hierarchical structure. They can create, delete, open, and close files, as well as gather various information about them, including access permissions, size,
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

and free space, and creation and modification dates. Various differences between file systems make supporting all file systems difficult. Allowed characters in file names, case sensitivity, and the presence of various kinds of file attributes makes the implementation of a single interface for every file system a daunting task. Operating systems tend to recommend using (and so support natively) file systems specifically designed for them; for example, NTFS in Windows and ext3 and ReiserFSin Linux. However, in practice, third party drivers are usually available to give support for the most widely used file systems in most general-purpose operating systems (for example, NTFS is available in Linux through NTFS-3g, and ext2/3 and ReiserFS are available in Windows through third-party software).
Support for file systems is highly varied among modern operating systems, although there are several common file systems which almost all operating systems include support and drivers for. Operating systems vary on file system support and on the disk formats they may be installed on. Under Windows, each file system is usually limited in application to certain media; for example, CDs must use ISO 9660 or UDF, and as of Windows Vista, NTFS is the only file system which the operating system can be installed on. It is possible to install Linux onto many types of file systems.
Unlike other operating systems, Linux and UNIX allow any file system to be used regardless of the media it is stored in, whether it is a hard drive, a disc (CD, DVD...), a USB flash drive, or even contained within a file located on another file system.

    <string name="operating_system">
        An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware resources, runs other programs, and provides common services for the user and application software.
For hardware functions such as input  output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between application programs and the computer hardware. Operating systems are found on any device that contains a computer - from cellular phones and video game consoles to supercomputers and web servers.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Examples of popular modern operating systems are: UNIX (Linux  Mac OS),Microsoft Windows and various systems like Android and iOS. Early computers were built to perform a series of single tasks, like a calculator. Operating systems did not exist in their modern and more complex forms until the early 1960s.
When personal (home) computers by Companies such as Apple Inc., Atari, IBM and Amiga became popular in the 1980s, vendors added operating system features, such as multi-user and multi-tasking functionality, that had previously become widely used on mainframe and minicomputers (that once bridged the gap between mainframes and PCs). Later, many features such as graphical user interfaces were developed specifically for personal computer operating systems.
An operating system consists of many parts. One of the most important components is the kernel, which controls low-level processes 8 that the average user usually cannot see: it controls how memory is read and written, the order in which processes (running programs) are executed, how information is received and sent by devices like the monitor, keyboard and mouse, and decides how to interpret information received from networks. The user interface is a component that directly interacts with the computer user, allowing him or her to control and run programs. The user interface may be graphical with icons and a desktop, or textual, with a command line. Application programming interfaces provide services and code libraries that let applications developers write modular code.
Which features are considered part of the operating system is defined differently by some. For example, Microsoft Windows considers its user interface to be part of the operating system, as described above. On the other hand, UNIX and Linux have a long history of allowing the end user to choose, or even to create their own, user interface.

For our purposes, the operating system always resides in RAM while the computer is operating.

Types of operating systems
 Single- And Multi– Tasking
A single-tasking system can only run one program at a time, while a multi-tasking operating system allows more than one program to be running in concurrency. This is achieved by time-sharing, dividing the available processor time between multiple processes that are each interrupted repeatedly in time slices by a task-scheduling subsystem of the operating system. Multi-tasking may be characterized in preemptive and co-operative types.
In preemptive multitasking, the operating system slices the CPU time and dedicates a slot to each of the programs.
UNIX-like operating systems, e.g., Solaris, Linux, as well as AmigaOS support preemptive multitasking. Cooperative multitasking is achieved by relying on each process to provide time to the other processes in a defined manner. 16-bit versions of Microsoft Windows used cooperative multi-tasking. 32-bit versions of both Windows NT and Win9x used preemptive multi-tasking.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

 Single- And Multi-User
Single-user operating systems have no facilities to distinguish users, but may allow multiple programs to run in tandem. A multi-user operating system extends the basic concept of multi-tasking with facilities that identify processes and resources, such as disk space, belonging to multiple users, and the system permits multiple users to interact with the system at the same time. Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources to multiple users.
 Distributed
A distributed operating system manages a group of distinct computers and makes them appear to be a single computer. The development of networked computers that could be linked and communicate with each other gave rise to distributed computing. Distributed computations are carried out on more than one machine. When computers in a group work in cooperation, they form a distributed system.
 Templated
In an OS, distributed and cloud computing context, templating refers to creating a single virtual machine image as a guest operating system, then saving it as a tool for multiple running virtual machines. The
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

technique is used both in virtualization and cloud computing management, and is common in large server warehouses.
 Embedded
Embedded operating systems are designed to be used in embedded computer systems. They are designed to operate on small machines like PDAs with less autonomy. They are able to operate with a limited number of resources. They are very compact and extremely efficient by design. Windows CE and Minx 3 are some examples of embedded operating systems.
 Real-time
A real - time operating system is an operating system that guarantees to process events or data by a specific moment in time. A real-time operating system may be single- or multi-tasking, but when multitasking, it uses specialized scheduling algorithms so that a deterministic nature of behavior is
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

achieved. An event-driven system switches between tasks based on their priorities or external events while time-sharing operating systems switch tasks based on clock interrupts
 Library
A library operating system is one in which the services that a typical operating system provides, such as networking, are provided in the form of libraries and composed with the application and configuration code to construct a unikernel: a specialized, single address space, machine image that can be deployed to cloud or embedded environments.
 UNIX and UNIX-Like Operating Systems
UNIX was originally written in assembly language. Ken Thompson wrote B, mainly based on BCPL, based on his experience in the MULTICS project. B was replaced by C, and UNIX, rewritten in C, developed into a large, complex family of inter-related operating systems which have been influential in every modern operating system.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

The Unix-like family is a diverse group of operating systems, with several major sub-categories including System V,BSD, and Linux. The name "UNIX" is a trademark of The Open Group which licenses it for use with any operating system that has been shown to conform to their definitions. "UNIX-like" is commonly used to refer to the large set of operating systems which resemble the original UNIX.
Unix-like systems run on a wide variety of computer architectures. They are used heavily for servers in business, as well as workstations in academic and engineering environments. Free UNIX variants, such as Linux and BSD, are popular in these areas.
Four operating systems are certified by The Open Group (holder of the UNIX trademark) as UNIX. HPs HP-UX and IBMs AIX are both descendants of the original System V Unix and are designed to run only on their respective vendors hardware.
In contrast, Sun Microsystemss Solaris scan run on multiple types of hardware, including x86 and Sparc servers, and PCs. Apples macOS, a replacement for Apples earlier (non-Unix) Mac OS, is a hybrid kernel-based BSD variant derived from NeXTSTEP, Mach, and FreeBSD. UNIX interoperability was sought by establishing the POSIX standard.
The POSIX standard can be applied to any operating system, although it was originally created for various UNIX variants.

Evolution of UNIX systems.
 BSD and Its Descendants
A subgroup of the UNIX family is the Distribution family, which includes FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. These operating systems are most commonly found on webservers, although they can also function as a personal computer OS. The Internet owes much of its existence to BSD, as many of the protocols now commonly used by computers to connect, send and receive data over a network were widely
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

implemented and refined in BSD. The Web was also first demonstrated on a number of computers running an OS based on BSD called NeXTSTEP.
In 1974, Berkeley installed its first UNIX system. Over time, students and staff in the computer science department there began adding new programs to make things easier, such as text editors. When Berkeley received new VAX computers in 1978 with UNIX installed, the schools undergraduates modified UNIX even more in order to take advantage of the computers hardware possibilities. The Defense Advanced Research Agency of the US Defense took interest, and decided to fund the project. Many schools, corporations, and government organizations took notice and started to use Berkeleys version of UNIX instead of the official one distributed by ATT.
Steve Jobs, upon leaving Apple Inc. in 1985, formed NeXT Inc., a company that manufactured high-end computers running on a variation of BSD called NeXTSTEP. One of these computers was used by Berners-Lee as the first web server to create the World Wide Web.
Developers like Keith Bosticen courage the project to replace any non-free code that originated with Bell Labs. Once this was done, however, ATT sued. After two years of legal disputes, the BSD project spawned a number of free derivatives, such as NetBSD and FreeBSD (both in 1993), and OpenBSD (from NetBSD in 1995).

MacOS (formerly "Mac OS X" and later "OS X") is a line of core graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Apple Inc., the latest of which is pre-loaded on all currently shipping Macintosh computers. MacOS is the successor to the original classic Mac OS, which had been Apples primary operating system since 1984. Unlike its predecessor, macOS is a UNIX operating system built on
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

technology that had been developed at Next through the second half of the 1980s and up until Apple purchased the company in early 1997. The operating system was first released in 1999 as Mac OS XServer 1.0, followed in March 2001 by a client version (Mac OS X v10.0 "Cheetah").
Since then, six more distinct "client" and "server" editions of macOS have been released, until the two were merged in OS X 10.7 "Lion".
Prior to its merging with macOS, the server edition - macOS Server- was architecturally identical to its desktop counterpart and usually ran on Apples line of Macintosh server hardware. macOS Server included work group management and administration software tools that provide simplified access to key network services, including a mail transfer agent, a Samba server, an LDAP server, a server, and others.
With Mac OS X v10.7 Lion, all server aspects of Mac OS X Server have been integrated into the client version and the product re-branded as "OS X" (dropping "Mac" from the name). The server tools are now offered as an application.
 Linux
The Linux kernel originated in 1991, as a project of Linus Torvalds, while a university student in Finland. He posted information about his project on a newsgroup for computer students and programmers, and received support and assistance from volunteers who succeeded in creating a complete and functional kernel.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Linux is Unix-like, but was developed without any UNIX code, unlike BSD and its variants. Because of its open license model, the Linux kernel code is available for study and modification, which resulted in its use on a wide range of computing machinery from supercomputers to smart-watches.
Although estimates suggest that Linux is used on only 1.82% of all "desktop" (or laptop) PCs, it has been widely adopted for use in servers and embedded systems such as cell phones.
Linux has superseded UNIX on many platforms and is used on most supercomputers including the top 385. Many of the same computers are also on Green 500(but in different order), and Linux runs on the top 10. Linux is also commonly used on other small energy-efficient computers, such as Smartphone and smart watches.
The Linux kernel is used in some popular distributions, such as Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Googles Android, Chrome OS, and Chromium OS.

Microsoft Windows
Microsoft Windows is a family of proprietary operating systems designed by Microsoft Corporation and primarily targeted to Intel architecture based computers, with an estimated 88.9 percent total usage share on Web connected computers. The latest version is Windows 10.In 2011, Windows 7 overtook Windows XP as most common version in use.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Microsoft Windows was first released in 1985, as an environment running on top of MS-DOS, which was the standard operating system shipped on most Intel architecture personal computers at the time. In 1995, Windows 95 was released which only used MS-DOS as a bootstrap.
For backwards compatibility, Win9x could run real-mode MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows 3.xdrivers. Windows ME, released in 2000, was the last version in the Win9x family. Later versions have all been based on the Windows NT kernel. Current client versions of Windows run on IA-32, x86-64 and 32-bit ARM microprocessors. In addition Itanium is still supported in older server version Windows Server 2008 R2. In the past, Windows NT supported additional architectures.
Server editions of Windows are widely used. In recent years, Microsoft has expended significant capital in an effort to promote the use of Windows as a server operating system.
However, Windows usage on servers is not as widespread as on personal computers as Windows competes against Linux and BSD for server market share. ReactOS is a Windows-alternative operating system, which is being developed on the principles of Windows - without using any of Microsofts code.

 Other
There have been many operating systems that were significant in their day but are no longer so, such as AmigaOS; OS/2from IBM and Microsoft; classic Mac OS, the non-Unix precursor to Apples macOS; BeOS; XTS-300;RISC OS; MorphOS; Haiku; Bare Metal and Free Mint. Some are still used in niche markets and continue to be developed as minority platforms for enthusiast communities and specialist applications. OpenVMS, formerly from DEC, is still under active development by Hewlett-Packard. Yet other operating systems are used almost exclusively in academia, for operating systems education or to do research on operating system concepts. A typical example of a system that fulfills both roles is MINIX, while for example Singularity is used purely for research. Other operating systems have failed to win significant market share, but have introduced innovations that have influenced mainstream operating systems, not least Bell Labs Plan 9.
 Components
The components of an operating system all exist in order to make the different parts of a computer work together. All user software needs to go through the operating system in order to use any of the hardware, whether it is as simple as a mouse or keyboard or as complex as an Internet component.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

 Kernel
With the aid of the firmware and device drivers, the kernel provides the most basic level of control over all of the computers hardware devices. It manages memory access for programs in the RAM, it determines which programs get access to which hardware resources, it sets up or resets the CPUs operating states for optimal operation at all times, and it organizes the data for long-term non-volatile storage with file systems on such media as disks, tapes, flash memory, etc.
A kernel connects the application software to the Hardware of a computer.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

 Program Execution
The operating system provides an interface between an application program and the computer hardware, so that an application program can interact with the hardware only by obeying rules and procedures programmed into the operating system. The operating system is also a set of services which simplify development and execution of application programs. Executing an application program involves the creation of a process by the operating system kernel which assigns memory space and other resources, establishes a priority for the process in multi-tasking systems, and loads program binary code into memory, and initiates execution of the Application program which then interacts with the user and with hardware devices.
 Interrupts
Interrupts are central to operating systems, as they provide an efficient way for the operating system to interact with and react to its environment. The alternative - having the operating system "watch" the various sources of input for events (polling) that require action - can be found in older systems with very small stacks(50 or 60 bytes) but is unusual in modern systems with large stacks. Interrupt-based programming is directly supported by most modern CPUs. Interrupts provide a computer with a way of automatically saving local register contexts, and running specific code in response to events. Even very basic computers support hardware interrupts, and allow the programmer to specify code which may be run when that event takes place.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

When an interrupt is received, the computers hardware automatically suspends whatever program is currently running, saves its status, and runs computer code previously associated with the interrupt; this is analogous to placing a bookmark in a book in response to a phone call. In modern operating systems, interrupts are handled by the operating systems kernel. Interrupts may come from either the computers hardware or the running program.
When a hardware device triggers an interrupt, the operating systems kernel decides how to deal with this event, generally by running some processing code. The amount of code being run depends on the priority of the interrupt (for example: a person usually responds to a smoke detector alarm before answering the phone). The processing of hardware interrupts is a task that is usually delegated to software called a device driver, which may be part of the operating systems kernel, part of another program, or both. Device drivers may then relay information to a running program by various means.
A program may also trigger an interrupt to the operating system. If a program wishes to access hardware, for example, it may interrupt the operating systems kernel, which causes control to be passed back to the kernel. The kernel then processes the request. If a program wishes additional resources (or wishes to shed resources) such as memory, it triggers an interrupt to get the kernels attention.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

 Modes
Odern microprocessors (CPU or MPU) support multiple modes of operation. CPUs with this capability offer at least two modes: user mode and supervisor mode. In general terms, supervisor mode operation allows unrestricted access to all machine resources, including all MPU instructions. User mode operation sets limits on instruction use and typically disallows direct access to machine resources. CPUs might have other modes similar to user mode as well, such as the virtual modes in order to emulate older processor types, such as 16-bit processors on a 32-bit one, or 32-bit processors on a 64-bitone. At power-on or reset, the system begins in supervisor mode. Once an operating system kernel has been loaded and started, the boundary between user mode and supervisor mode (also known as kernel mode) can be established.
Managers, operate within user mode, and can only access machine resources by turning control over to the kernel, a process which causes a switch to supervisor mode. Typically, the transfer of control to the kernel is achieved by executing a software interrupt instruction, such as the Motorola 68000 TRAP instruction. The software interrupt causes the microprocessor to switch from user mode to supervisor mode and begin executing code that allows the kernel to take control.
In user mode, programs usually have access to a restricted set of microprocessor instructions, and generally cannot execute any instructions that could potentially cause disruption to the systems operation. In supervisor mode, instruction execution restrictions are typically removed, allowing the kernel unrestricted access to all machine resources.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

The term "user mode resource" generally refers to one or more CPU registers, which contain information that the running program isnt allowed to alter. Attempts to alter these resources generally causes a switch to supervisor mode, where the operating system can deal with the illegal operation the program was attempting, for example, by forcibly terminating ("killing") the program).

        Operating system development is one of the most complicated activities in which a computing hobbyist may engage. A hobby operating system may be classified as one whose code has not been directly derived from an existing operating system, and has few users and active.
In some cases, hobby development is in support of a "homebrew" computing device, for example, a simple single-board computer powered by a 6502 microprocessor. Or, development may be for
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

architecture already in widespread use. Operating system development may come from entirely new concepts, or may commence by modeling an existing operating system. In either case, the hobbyist is his/her own developer, or may interact with a small and sometimes unstructured group of individuals who have like interests.
Examples Of A Hobby Operating System Include Syllable.
Diversity Of Operating Systems And Portability
Application software is generally written for use on a specific operating system, and sometimes even for specific hardware. When porting the application to run on another OS, the functionality required by that application may be implemented differently by that OS (the names of functions, meaning of arguments, etc.) requiring the application to be adapted, changed, or otherwise maintained.
UNIX was the first operating system not written in assembly language, making it very portable to systems different from its native PDP-11.
This cost in supporting operating systems diversity can be avoided by instead writing applications against software platforms like Java or Qt. These abstractions have already borne the cost of adaptation to specific operating systems and their libraries. Another approach is for operating system vendors to adopt standards. For example, POSIX and OS abstraction layers provide commonalities that reduce porting costs.

Embedded operating system
While the distinction is mostly import to technophiles, hand-held devices (including early Smartphone) use (d) a class of operating system that is called "embedded". (Of embedded.) Embedded systems, on the other hand, is a term generally used to refer to (usually real-time) systems with limited functionality. Embedded systems are quite common. They are in many devices, such as cars, microwave ovens, printers, etc. Embedded-OS devices are becoming much more common.
User Interface
From a user perspective, the user interface (typically a GUI) is the operating system. Actually this is just the way you, the user, can talk directly to the OS to accomplish system level tasks. As noted above, Microsoft considers the user interface to be a part of the OS, while some others, notably Linux, allow you to choose (and change) the interface. In the workplace, you typically will not have a choice because IT departments like to keep to one kind of system.
The video at right follows the progression of Microsoft desktop interfaces from DOS, a command line interface, to some guesses about Windows 7. (It was recorded before the release).
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

System Utilities
Utility software is a kind of system software designed to help analyze, configure, optimize and maintain the computer. A single piece of utility software is usually called a utility or tool.
Utility software should be contrasted with application software, which allows users to do things like creating text documents, playing games, listening to music or surfing the web. Rather than providing these kinds of user-oriented or output-oriented functionality, utility software usually focuses on how the computer infrastructure (including the computer hardware, operating system and application software and data storage) operates. Due to this focus, some utilities are rather technical and targeted at people with an advanced level of computer knowledge. Others are commonly used by all users - a task manager is shown on the right.
Most utilities are highly specialized and designed to perform only a single task or a small range of tasks. However, there are also some utility suites that combine several features in one piece of software. Most major operating systems come with several pre-installed utilities. You may have to (find and) add utilities for your Smartphone, though. Although utilities are part of the system software, they are not part of the OS per se. They are loaded into memory as needed, either by the user or the OS.
    </string>

    <string name="pos_networking">
        Currently most operating systems support a variety of networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them. This means that computers running dissimilar operating systems can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing, files, printers, and scanners using either wired or wireless connections. Networks can essentially allow a computers operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer.
This includes everything from simple communication, to using networked file systems or even sharing another computers graphics or sound hardware. Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently, such as SSH which allows networked users direct access to a computers command line interface.
Client/server networking allows a program on a computer, called a client, to connect via a network to another computer, called a server. Servers offer (or host) various services to other network computers and users. These services are usually provided through ports or numbered access points beyond the servers IP address. Each port number is usually associated with a maximum of one running program, which is responsible for handling requests to that port. A daemon, being a user program, can in turn access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the operating system kernel.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Many operating systems support one or more vendor-specific or open networking protocols as well, for example, SNA on IBM systems, DECnet on systems from Digital Equipment Corporation, and Microsoft-specific protocols (SMB) on Windows. Specific protocols for specific tasks may also be supported such as NFS for file access. Protocols like ESound, or esd can be easily extended over the network to provide sound from local applications, on a remote systems sound hardware.
Security
A computer being secure depends on a number of technologies working properly. A modern operating system provides access to a number of resources, which are available to software running on the system, and to external devices like networks via the kernel.
The operating system must be capable of distinguishing between requests which should be allowed to be processed, and others which should not be processed. While some systems may simply distinguish between "privileged" and "non-privileged", systems commonly have a form of requester identity, such as a user name. To establish identity there may be a process of authentication. Often a username must be quoted, and each username may have a password. Other methods of authentication, such as magnetic cards or biometric data, might be used instead. In some cases, especially connections from the network, resources may be accessed with no authentication at all (such as reading files over a network share). Also covered by the concept of requester identity is authorization; the particular services and resources accessible by the requester once logged into a system are tied to either the requesters user account or to the variously configured groups of users to which the requester belongs.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

In addition to the allow or disallow model of security, a system with a high level of security also offers auditing options. These would allow tracking of requests for access to resources (such as, "who has been reading this file?"). Internal security or security from an already running program is only possible if all possibly harmful requests must be carried out through interrupts to the operating system kernel. If programs can directly access hardware and resources, they cannot be secured.
External security involves a request from outside the computer, such as a login at a connected console or some kind of network connection. External requests are often passed through device drivers to the operating systems kernel, where they can be passed onto applications, or carried out directly. Security of operating systems has long been a concern because of highly sensitive data held on computers, both of a commercial and military nature. The United States Government Department of Defense(DoD) created the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria(TCSEC) which is a standard that sets basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of security. This became of vital importance to operating system makers, because the TCSEC was used to evaluate, classify and select trusted operating systems being considered for the processing, storage and retrieval of sensitive.
Classified Information
Network services include offerings such as file sharing, print services, email, web sites, and file transfer protocols (FTP), most of which can have compromised security. At the front line of security are hardware devices known as firewalls or intrusion detection/prevention systems. At the operating system level, there
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

are a number of software firewalls available, as well as intrusion detection/prevention systems. Most modern operating systems include a software firewall, which is enabled by default. A software firewall can be configured to allow or deny network traffic to or from a service or application running on the operating system. Therefore, one can install and be running an insecure service, such as Telnet or FTP, and not have to be threatened by a security breach because the firewall would deny all traffic trying to connect to the service on that port.
An alternative strategy, and the only sandbox strategy available in systems that do not meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements, is where the operating system is not running user programs as native code, but instead either emulates a processor or provides a host for a p-code based system such as Java.
Internal security is especially relevant for multi-user systems; it allows each user of the system to have private files that the other users cannot tamper with or read. Internal security is also vital if auditing is to be of any use, since a program can potentially bypass the operating system, inclusive of bypassing auditing.

        Security Tools
Most PC systems include basic security tools. These can be replaced or supplemented, but should be used immediately. Connecting a PC to the Internet will lead to attacks very quickly, often within seconds. Using the tools below and following the suggestions will give you a reasonable chance of avoiding, catching or blocking, and removing most of the malware discussed in the last module.
Obviously avoidance is best. Re-read the quick tips in the sidebar above.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Firewall
A firewall is a device or set of devices designed to permit or deny network transmissions based upon a set of rules and is frequently used to protect networks from unauthorized access while permitting legitimate communications to pass.
Note that illegitimate outgoing communications can also be blocked. Many personal computer operating systems include software-based firewalls to protect against threats from the public Internet. Many routers that pass data between networks contain a firewall also. (You probably have a wireless router in your home.)
Without proper configuration, a firewall can often become worthless. Standard security practices dictate a "default-deny" firewall ruleset, in which the only network connections which are allowed are the ones that have been explicitly allowed.
Unfortunately, such a configuration requires detailed understanding of the network applications and endpoints required for the organizations day-to-day operation. Many businesses lack such understanding, and therefore implement a "default-allow" ruleset, in which all traffic is allowed unless it has been specifically blocked. This configuration makes inadvertent network connections and system compromise much more likely.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

 Antivirus
Antivirus (AV) or anti-virus software is used to prevent, detect, and remove malware, including but not limited to computer viruses, computer worms, Trojan horses, spyware and adware. Most AV programs provide on-access scans of any program that you run or download for install. Some extend this to your email as well.
A variety of strategies are typically employed. Signature-based detection involves searching for known patterns of data within executable code. However, it is possible for a computer to be infected with new
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

malware for which no signature is yet known. To counter such so-called zero-day threats, heuristics can be used. One type of heuristic approach, generic signatures, can identify new viruses or variants of existing viruses by looking for known malicious code, or slight variations of such code, in files. Some antivirus software can also predict what a file will do by running it in a sandbox and analyzing what it does to see if it performs any malicious actions.
No matter how useful antivirus software can be, it can sometimes have drawbacks. Antivirus software can impair a computers performance. (This is why some Smartphone and Mac users choose not to run AV software.) If the antivirus software employs heuristic detection, success depends on achieving the right balance between false positives and false negatives. (A false positive means that useful, safe software will be flagged as dangerous.) Finally, antivirus software generally runs at the highly trusted kernel level of the operating system, creating a potential avenue of attack.
 Anti-Spyware
Although most antivirus programs claim to detect and remove spyware and adware, they are sometimes not as good at this as software intended specifically for this task. This is at least partly due to the controversy over what exactly qualifies as spyware and adware (discussed in the last module). Many experts recommend that you use multiple software defenses, although the second or third are usually employed as manually run scans (not on-access).
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

 Specific Tools
There are a number of AV packages available and they are sold (or distributed for free) in various suites, that is with differing components, for example, Norton Antivirus with Antispyware, Norton Internet Security, and Norton 360 All-In-One Security, all by Symantec. Comments here are general. You should refer to the software web site (and Google it) for more information.
An example of free antivirus software: ClamTk3.08
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Norton and McAfee are well-known suites of protection tools. They have the advantage of a large companys quick reaction to new threats but the disadvantage of using a lot of system resources itself. MacAfee Enterprise Edition is for businesses.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

At SRU, any student or employee can get a copy of this version for their laptop or home computer for free. Webroot, Kaspersky, and Bit defender are all rated well in the review linked above. Avg is a well-respected AV package. A free version is available for 30 days. Malware bytes provides a free version, although the free version does not provide on-access scans. At SRU, I have used this in conjunction with McAfee Enterprise successfully.
All these are types of an Antivirus.

 Protecting the system from ourselves
As Louis Binstock said, "we are our own worst enemy". Not only do we delete the file we need, fail to keep a copy before editing, ignore updates, spill coffee on the system, or drop a laptop, we are also responsible for installing most of the programs that harm our computer systems. Sometimes this is explicitly downloading a program containing adware or spyware, other times it is because we are using an account that has administrator privileges. The former may be a choice, the latter certainly is, and a poor one at that.
In the early days of personal computing, a PC didnt have accounts. There was a single user that both used and administered the machine. This has evolved to systems that allow the creation of user accounts with various privileges, that are protected from one another, and that have a separate administrative account. All of these steps match what was done on multi-user operating systems used in IT departments (and as servers) many years before. Unfortunately, most PC users simply use the administrator account. Create and use a "normal" account. Only use administrator privileges when needed.
 Backup And Restore
It is a fair assumption that everyone has lost a file they needed. Often it is not lost to malware, but either hardware failure or our own failure to backup files. There are tools that will assist you in making backups,
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

or you can manually copy your data to another drive. The advantage to manual backup is that it is fast. The disadvantage is that it is not scheduled. It is not automatic. Whatever the cause of the loss may be, it represents time and effort. Make a backup plan and stick to it.
There are online services for backing up your files. These services run a program that is scheduled to automatically backup your files (while you sleep). They have an additional advantage of offering off-site backup. A second hard drive in your computer is also vulnerable to malware and an external drive, even when not connected, is susceptible to theft or fire. The biggest disadvantage of such a service is that you are trusting a third party with your data: work, pictures, saved email, etc. Make sure they encrypt your data to stop casual perusal by employees and theft by others. But, remember that they may have the encryption key. Restore points are a type of backup for the system itself. Create a restore point before installing software, partitioning a drive, etc.
 Authentication
Authentication refers to the process of making sure a user has access to the resource, usually the entire system; that is, logging on. If you are using accounts, as recommended above, you can also protect your files from other users. They can be given permission to change (delete), read, or denied access. When you attempt to access a resource you do not have permission for, or install a program, you are generally prompted to give permission (and authenticated). You may have to log in as an administrator to accomplish some tasks - then switch back to your user account.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Standard authentication is accomplished with a password. Password that is hard to guess: 8-12 (or more) characters and including non-alphabetical characters that you can remember. Random would be great, if you have that kind of memory. Otherwise consider modifying a phrase that is meaningful to you (ignore any spaces). For example, your favorite dog is named Princess (and she has paws):
 PrinceSaysPause - WEAK, uses caps, but uses all dictionary words
 PrintSezPauzz - better, but all letters
 Pr1n5essP0z - good, three digits (the 1 is read as an I, 5 is an S, and 0 an O)
 Pr1nse55-P0z - very good, 4 digits and hyphen
 Pr1nse55-P0z@@ - excellent, 14 characters long with digits, caps and "special" chars (Are those last two her paws or eyes?)
Dont forget that Princess "barqs", "jumpz", and "cud.del5" also. Its kind of endless, which is the point. If you choose to substitute digits or punctuation for letters like above (@b0v3), make sure you also "mis-spell" the word (phonetically). You can also mix and match the above with simple substitution ciphers (A becomes B, B becomes C, etc.), so "Princess paws" becomes "pr1nse55-qbxt".
You also need to manage your passwords. Change them regularly; once a semester is good rule for college students. Chances are someone else knows one of them. When your relationship ends, change your passwords - its like changing the locks, only easier. (Do you really want them reading your email?)
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Dont forget that many passwords are saved on PCs, laptops and Smartphone, including banking or online trading passwords. Secure the device first. Your Smartphone almost certainly has an authentication mechanism. Use it! It also keeps rude friends and significant others from perusing your texts, emails, and photos. Change all passwords if a device is lost or stolen.
Shoulder surfing refers to obtaining someones password (or PIN) through direct observation. You should not feel uncomfortable asking someone to "excuse you" while you type a password - and wait for them to comply.
 Encryption
Assume your PC (and online backup service) will eventually get hacked. Why not save your files in a way that prevents others from accessing them. Encryption packages are available (some are free) that will create a "container" file that appears like another disk drive to your system. Anything saved on that drive is actually saved in the encrypted container. (You do have to start this up before using it and make sure you close it down when done.) This is a must if you are using business files at home, working with healthcare information, or student grades. You can purchase flash drives that will protect your data also. They have the encryption software on them. (Kingston has been a leader.)
Note that if you encrypt a file or create an "encrypted volume" - a big file that acts like a separate encrypted disk - you can back that up on an encrypted cloud service. It will be encrypted twice and be that much harder to hack.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

 Speeding Up Your PC
There are a number of things you can do to speed up your PC, but the most effective is likely to be removing spyware and adware that you installed yourself. In addition, you will find that there are a number of programs that are running all the time, so they can "start" quickly when you select them. Scan for viruses, spyware and adware first. Remove whatever you can - some of the spyware and adware might be there because you want the program it came with. Most of the rest of this is for Windows, but I put in some links for OS X.
Uninstall programs you no longer use with the uninstall utility (Windows-
Control_Panel:_Add_or_remove_programs). For the Mac, some files can simply be dragged to the Trash, but "bundles" are more complicated: search for Uninstalling Applications in Mac OS Xon the web.
There are some system level things you can do, as well. Empty the trash bin to get rid of files you no longer need and run the disk clean up utility (Windows_Start:All_Programs:Accessories:System_Tools) to get rid of temporary internet files and other junk. Simply creating space on the hard disk will make it easier to place needed files in one contiguous location on the disk to speed up access. (No speed boost if you have an SSD drive, though.)
After cleaning up old files create a restore point and then defragment the hard disk (System Tools). This will optimize the location of files, again speeding up access. The more space you have available,
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

the better this will work, so clean up first. (Not necessary with SSD drives and Apple says dont bother defragging in OS X - in support article 25668.)
Finally, if you access the Windows Systems Properties (Control_Panel:_System), under the
Advanced tab, you will find System Performance. Select Performance Settings. Generally, Windows ships with "adjust for best appearance" selected. You can turn off features you dont care about, or all, by selecting "adjust for best performance”. The most common, and easiest, hardware solution is to add RAM.
 Setting Up A New PC
If youve purchased a new system and set it up physically, there are still some things you should do before you start browsing the web. Primarily, you need to update all the software on your "new" system, as it may actually be months old, and install antivirus software (if it didnt come pre-installed).
This is also a great time to write down all the processes that show up in the Task Manager for later reference. You can do this on an old system after you get rid of unwanted programs also. This is great for later comparisons to find malware. You probably also have an old system to get rid of. Recycle! And make sure you shred (wipe) the disk to protect your privacy.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

 Over Heating
You can help prevent over heating by keeping the inside of the (desktop) PC clean  organized.
Device Driver
In computing, a device driver is a computer program that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. A driver provides a software interface to hardware devices, enabling operating systems and other computer programs to access hardware functions without needing to know precise details about the hardware being used.
A driver communicates with the device through the computer bus or communications subsystem to which the hardware connects. When a calling program invokes a routine in the driver, the driver issues commands to the device. Once the device sends data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original calling program. Drivers are hardware dependent and operating-system-specific. They usually provide the interrupt handling required for any necessary a synchronous time-dependent hardware interface.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

 Purpose
The main purpose of device drivers is to provide abstraction by acting as a translator between a hardware device and the applications or operating systems that use it. Programmers can write higher-level application code independently of whatever specific hardware the end-user is using.
For example, a high-level application for interacting with a serial port may simply have two functions for "send data" and "receive data". At a lower level, a device driver implementing these functions would communicate to the particular serial port controller installed on a users computer. The commands needed to control a 16550 UART are much different from the commands needed to control an FTDI serial port converter, but each hardware-specific device driver abstracts these details into the same (or similar) software interface.
Development
Writing a device driver requires an in-depth understanding of how the hardware and the software works for a given platform function. Because drivers require low-level access to hardware functions in order to operate, drivers typically operate in a highly privileged environment and can cause system operational issues if something goes wrong. In contrast, most user-level software on modern operating systems can be stopped without greatly affecting the rest of the system. Even drivers executing in user mode can crash a
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

system if the device is erroneously programmed. These factors make it more difficult and dangerous to diagnose problems.
The task of writing drivers thus usually falls to software engineers or computer engineers who work for hardware-development companies. This is because they have better information than most outsiders about the design of their hardware. Moreover, it was traditionally considered in the hardware manufacturers interest to guarantee that their clients can use their hardware in an optimum way. Typically, the Logical Device Driver (LDD) is written by the operating system vendor, while the Physical Device Driver (PDD) is implemented by the device vendor. But in recent years non-vendors have written numerous device drivers, mainly for use with free and open source operating systems. In such cases, it is important that the hardware manufacturer provides information on how the device communicates. Although this information can instead be learned by reverse engineering, this is much more difficult with hardware than it is with software.
Microsoft has attempted to reduce system instability due to poorly written device drivers by creating a new framework for driver development, called Windows Driver Foundation (WDF). This includes User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) that encourages development of certain types of drivers—primarily those that implement a message-based protocol for communicating with their devices—as user-mode drivers. If such drivers malfunction, they do not cause system instability. The Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) model continues to allow development of kernel-mode device drivers, but attempts to provide standard implementations of functions that are known to cause problems, including cancellation of I/O operations, power management, and plug and play device support.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Apple has an open-source framework for developing drivers on macOS called the I/O Kit.
In Linux environments, programmers can build device drivers as parts of the kernel, separately as loadable modules, or as user-mode drivers (for certain types of devices where kernel interfaces exist, such as for USB devices). Makedev includes a list of the devices in Linux: ttyS (terminal), lp (parallel port), HD (disk), loop, sound (these include mixer, sequencer, dsp, and audio).
The Microsoft Windows .sys files and Linux .ko modules contain loadable device drivers. The advantage of loadable device drivers is that they can be loaded only when necessary and then unloaded, thus saving kernel memory.
Kernel Mode Vs. User Mode
Device drivers, particularly on modern Microsoft Windows platforms, can run in kernel-mode (Ring 0 on x86 CPUs) or in user-mode (Ring 3 on x86 CPUs). The primary benefit of running a driver in user mode is improved stability, since a poorly written user mode device driver cannot crash the system by overwriting kernel memory.
On the other hand, user/kernel-mode transitions usually impose a considerable performance overhead, thereby prohibiting user-mode drivers for low latency and high throughput requirements.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Kernel space can be accessed by user module only through the use of system calls. End user programs like the UNIX shell or other GUI-based applications are part of the user space. These applications interact with hardware through kernel supported functions.
Applications
Because of the diversity of modern hardware and operating systems, drivers operate in many different environments. Drivers may interface with:
 Printers
 Video adapters
 Network cards
 Sound cards
 Local buses of various sorts—in particular, for bus mastering on modern systems
 Low-bandwidth I/O buses of various sorts (for pointing devices such as mice, keyboards, USB, etc.)
 Computer storage devices such as hard disk, CD-ROM, and floppy disk buses (ATA, SATA, SCSI)
 Implementing support for different file systems
 Image scanners
 Digital cameras
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Common levels of abstraction for device drivers include:
 For hardware:
 Interfacing directly
 Writing to or reading from a device control register
 Using some higher-level interface (e.g. Video BIOS)
 Using another lower-level device driver (e.g. file system drivers using disk drivers)
 Simulating work with hardware, while doing something entirely different
 For software:
 Allowing the operating system direct access to hardware resources
 Implementing only primitives
 Implementing an interface for non-driver software (e.g. TWAIN)
 Implementing a language, sometimes quite high-level (e.g. PostScript)
So choosing and installing the correct device drivers for given hardware is often a key component of computer system configuration.

    <string name="system_software">
        Computer software, or simply software, is a part of a computer system that consists of data or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built.
Software is generally divided into two types: system software that keeps everything working, and application software that allows a user to accomplish some task (even if that task is playing Chess Titan, solitaire or Heart). In this module, we will look primarily at system software. Application software and a third category, malware, will be discussed in following modules.
System software has the task of making your computer a usable system. All application programs work with the system software to accomplish their tasks. System software has three components: the operating system, system utilities (OS helpers), and drivers.
As can be seen at right, the OS interacts with hardware through drivers.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

There is a plethora (Large or excessive amount of something) of computer hardware. For example, the number of disk drive models available, even from one manufacturer, can be surprisingly large. When you ask an application to "save" a file, it passes this request to the operating system. Rather than having the OS knows how to accomplish this task with every possible disk drive, it instead knows how to do it for a generic (or virtual) drive. The manufacturer of the disk drive provides a (typically small) program to implement the functionality on their particular hardware, i.e., the small program is the virtual disk drive. That program is called a driver.
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

An analogy that you may find useful is that the driver acts as a language interpreter. All interactions pass through the driver.
It is Key to note that, although the system you buy has many drivers pre-installed, those programs are provided by the device manufacturer. This is especially important if you are experiencing problems with a device or want to connect an unrecognized device. You will probably have to download a driver from the device manufacturer. That is, you might go to Western Digital for a disk driver, rather than Dell. (Some OEMs provide an easy way to do this, but they are really just redistributing software provided to them.)

    <string name="user_interface">
        User Interface
Every computer that is to be operated by an individual requires a user interface. The user interface is usually referred to as a shell and is essential if human interaction is to be supported. The user interface views the directory structure and requests services from the operating system that will acquire data from input hardware devices, such as a keyboard, mouse or credit card reader, and requests operating system
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

services to display prompts, status messages and such on output hardware devices, such as a video monitor or printer.
The two most common forms of a user interface have historically been the command-line interface, where computer commands are typed out line-by-line, and the graphical user interface, where a visual environment (most commonly a WIMP) is present.
A screenshot of the Bash command line. Each Command is typed out after the prompt, and then its output appears below, working its way down the screen. The current command prompt is at the bottom.

 Graphical User Interfaces
Most of the modern computer systems support graphical user interfaces (GUI), and often include them. In some computer systems, such as the original implementation of the classic Mac OS, the GUI is integrated into the kernel. While technically a graphical user interface is not an operating system service, incorporating support for one into the operating system kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by reducing the number of context switches required for the GUI to perform its output functions. Other operating systems are modular, separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the Operating System. In the 1980s UNIX, VMS and many others had operating systems that were built this way. Linux and macOS are also built this way. Modern releases of Microsoft Windows such as Windows Vista implement a graphics subsystem that is mostly in user-space; however the graphics drawing routines of versions between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003 exist mostly in kernel space. Windows 9x had very little distinction between the interface and the kernel.
Many computer operating systems allow the user to install or create any user interface they desire. The X Window System in conjunction with GNOME or KDE Plasma 5 is a commonly found setup on most Unix and Unix-like(BSD, Linux, Solaris) systems. A number of Windows shell replacement shave been released for Microsoft Windows, which offer alternatives to the included Windows shell, but the shell Numerous Unix-based GUIs have existed over time, most derived from X11.
Competition among the various vendors of Unix (HP, IBM, Sun) led to much fragmentation, though an effort to standardize in the 1990s to COSE and CDE failed for various reasons, and were eventually eclipsed
POSH APP - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

by the wide spread adoption of GNOME and K Desktop Environment. Prior to free software-based toolkits and desktop environments, Motif was the prevalent toolkit/desktop combination (and was the basis upon which CDE was developed). Graphical user interfaces evolve over time. For example, Windows has modified its user interface almost every time a new major version of Windows is released, and the Mac OS GUI changed dramatically with the introduction of Mac OS X in 1999. It cannot be separated from Windows.

Real-Time Operating Systems
A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system intended for applications with fixed deadlines (real-time computing). Such applications include some small embedded systems, automobile engine controllers, industrial robots, spacecraft, industrial control, and some large-scale computing systems. An early example of a large-scale real-time operating system was Transaction Processing Facility developed by American Airlines and IBM for the Sabre Airline Reservations System.
Embedded systems that have fixed deadlines use a real-time operating system such as VxWorks, PikeOS, eCos, QNX, MontaVista Linux and RTLinux. Windows CE is a real-time operating system that shares similar APIs to desktop Windows but shares none of desktop Windows codebase. Symbian OS also has an RTOS kernel (EKA2) starting with version 8.0 b. Some embedded systems use operating systems such as Palm OS,BSD, and Linux, although such operating systems do not support real-time computing.

    <string name="virtual_device_driver">
        Virtual device drivers represent a particular variant of device drivers. They are used to emulate a hardware device, particularly in virtualization environments, for example when a DOS program is run on a Microsoft Windows computer or when a guest operating system is run on, for example, a Xen host. Instead of enabling the guest operating system to dialog with hardware, virtual device drivers take the opposite role and emulates a piece of hardware, so that the guest operating system and its drivers running inside a virtual machine can have the illusion of accessing real hardware. Attempts by the guest operating system to access the hardware are routed to the virtual device driver in the host operating system as e.g., function calls. The virtual device driver can also send simulated processor-level events like interrupts into the virtual machine.
Virtual devices may also operate in a non-virtualized environment. For example, a virtual network adapter is used with a virtual private network, while a virtual disk device is used with iSCSI. A good example for virtual device drivers can be Daemon Tools. There are several variants of virtual device drivers, such as VxDs, VLMs, and VDDs.

         Definition - What does Hacking mean?
Hacking generally refers to unauthorized intrusion into a computer or a network. The person engaged in hacking activities is known as a hacker. This hacker may alter system or security features to accomplish a goal that differs from the original purpose of the system.
Hacking can also refer to non-malicious activities, usually involving unusual or improvised alterations to equipment or processes.
 Hackers employ a variety of techniques for hacking, including:
 Vulnerability scanner: checks computers on networks for known weaknesses
 Password cracking: the process of recovering passwords from data stored or transmitted by computer systems
 Packet sniffer: applications that capture data packets in order to view data and passwords in transit over networks
 Spoofing attack: involves websites which falsify data by mimicking legitimate sites, and they are therefore treated as trusted sites by users or other programs
 Root kit: represents a set of programs which work to subvert control of an operating system from legitimate operators
 Trojan horse: serves as a back door in a computer system to allow an intruder to gain access to the system later
 Viruses: self-replicating programs that spread by inserting copies of themselves into other executable code files or documents
 Key loggers: tools designed to record every keystroke on the affected machine for later retrieval
Certain corporations employ hackers as part of their support staff. These legitimate hackers use their skills to find flaws in the company security system, thus preventing identity theft and other computer-related crimes.

         10 Types of Hackers You Should Know by Shikha Aukta
"If you wish to learn about the various types of hackers in the online world and burst the Hollywood image of a hacker in your mind, keep reading on."
Whenever I used to imagine hackers, I always pictured this notorious guy wearing a ski-mask glued to his laptop with green lines of text filling up the screen space. However dramatic that may look, it holds no truth. People think hackers are negative people in the online world, but we all know theres more to the story.
Just like there are good and bad guys in the real world with different shades of their personality, the types of hackers vary by their agenda, methodologies and skill practice. In this post, Ill introduce the well-known and lesser-known kinds of hackers you should know.
This will help you understand what kind of protection you require for your system and who are the faceless criminals targeting your personal or business information. Before you become proactive for your safety, it is essential to understand what you are facing or fighting.
So now, lets begin
1. White Hat Hackers/Ethical Hacker
Meet the right guys on the dark web. White hat hackers, also known as ethical hackers are the cyber security experts who help the Govt and organizations by performing penetration testing and identifying loopholes in their cyber security. They even do other methodologies and ensure protection from black hat hackers and other malicious cyber-crimes.
Simply stated, these are the right people who are on your side. They will hack into your system with the good intention of finding vulnerabilities and help you remove virus and malware from your system.
2. Black Hat Hackers/Cracker
Taking credit for the negative persona around "hacking," these guys are your culprits. A black hat hacker is the type of hacker you should be worried. Heard news about a new cybercrime today? One of the black hat hackers may be behind it.
While their agenda may be monetary most of the time, its not always just that. These hackers look for vulnerabilities in individual PCs, organizations and bank systems. Using any loopholes they may find, they can hack into your network and get access to your personal, business and financial information.
3. Gray Hat Hackers
Gray hat hackers‘ fall somewhere in between white hat and black hat hackers. While they may not use their skills for personal gain, they can, however, have both good and bad intentions. For instance, a hacker who hacks into an organization and finds some vulnerability may leak it over the Internet or inform the organization about it.
It all depends upon the hacker. Nevertheless, as soon as hackers use their hacking skills for personal gain they become black hat hackers. There is a fine line between these two. So, let me make it simple for you.
Because a gray hat hacker doesnt use his skills for personal gain, he is not a black hat hacker. Also, because he is not legally authorized to hack the organizations cyber security, he cant be considered a white hat either. So, these were the most commonly known and referred hackers. But theres more. Lets learn a little more about the other types of hackers as well today.
4. Script Kiddies
A derogatory term often used by amateur hackers who dont care much about the coding skills. These hackers usually download tools or use available hacking codes written by other developers and hackers. Their primary purpose is often to impress their friends or gain attention.
However, they dont care about learning. By using off-the-shelf codes and tools, these hackers may launch some attacks without bothering for the quality of the attack. Most common cyber-attacks by script kiddies might include DoS and DDoS attacks.
5. Green Hat Hackers
These hackers are the amateurs in the online world of hacking. Consider them script kiddies but with a difference. These newbies have a desire to become full-blown hackers and are very curious to learn. You may find them engrossed in the hacking communities bombarding their fellow hackers with questions.
You can identify them by their spark to grow and learn more about the hacking trade. Once you answer a single question, the hackers will listen with undivided attention and ask another question until you answer all their queries.
6. Blue Hat Hackers
These are another form of novice hackers much like script kiddies whose main agenda is to take revenge on anyone who makes them angry. They have no desire for learning and may use simple cyber-attacks like flooding your IP with overloaded packets which will result in DoS attacks.
A script kiddie with a vengeful agenda can be considered a blue hat hacker.
7. Red Hat Hackers
Red Hat Hackers have an agenda similar to white hat hackers which in simple words is halting the acts of Black hat hackers. However, there is a major difference in the way they operate. They are ruthless when it comes to dealing with black hat hackers.
Instead of reporting a malicious attack, they believe in taking down the black hat hacker completely. Red hat hacker will launch a series of aggressive cyber-attacks and malware on the hacker that the hacker may as well have to replace the whole system.
8. State/Nation Sponsored Hackers
State or Nation sponsored hackers are those who have been employed by their state or nations government to snoop in and penetrate through full security to gain confidential information from other governments to stay at the top online.
They have an endless budget and extremely advanced tools at their disposal to target individuals, companies or rival nations.
9. Hacktivist
If youve ever come across social activists propagandizing a social, political or religious agenda, then you might as well meet hacktivist, the online version of an activist. Hacktivist is a hacker or a group of anonymous hackers who think they can bring about social changes and often hack government and organizations to gain attention or share their displeasure over opposing their line of thought.
10. Malicious Insider or Whistleblower
A malicious insider or a whistleblower may be an employee with a grudge or a strategic employee compromised or hired by rivals to garner trade secrets of their opponents to stay on top of their game. These hackers may take privilege from their easy access to information and their role within the company to hack the system.
 Types of Hackers: Wrap Up
I hope this post cleared up your thoughts on the kinds of hackers out there and helped you get a new insight into the hacking world.
It is essential to stay aware and vigilant to protect yourself from the cyber threats and different types of hackers who may use even the smallest vulnerability in your system against you.
I hope youll stay safe and aware. Have a secure web experience and remain protected.

    <string name="ethical_hacking">
         What is Ethical Hacking?
Ethical Hacking is identifying weakness in computer systems and/or computer networks and coming with countermeasures that protect the weaknesses. Ethical hackers must abide by the following rules.
 Get written permission from the owner of the computer system and/or computer network before hacking.
 Protect the privacy of the organization been hacked.
 Transparently report all the identified weaknesses in the computer system to the organization.
 Inform hardware and software vendors of the identified weaknesses.
 Why Ethical Hacking?
 Information is one of the most valuable assets of an organization. Keeping information secure can protect an organization‘s image and save an organization a lot of money.
 Hacking can lead to loss of business for organizations that deal in finance such as PayPal. Ethical hacking puts them a step ahead of the cyber criminals who would otherwise lead to loss of business.
 Legality of Ethical Hacking
Ethical Hacking is legal if the hacker abides by the rules stipulated in the above section on the definition of ethical hacking. The International Council of E-Commerce Consultants (EC-Council) provides a certification program that tests individual‘s skills. Those who pass the examination are awarded with certificates. The certificates are supposed to be renewed after some time.
 Summary
 Hacking is identifying and exploiting weaknesses in computer systems and/or computer networks.
 Cybercrime is committing a crime with the aid of computers and information technology infrastructure.
 Ethical Hacking is about improving the security of computer systems and/or computer networks.
 Ethical Hacking is legal.

    <string name="how_to_become_a_hacker">
        The steps that need to be taken to become a hacker are not easy. This article will give you few of the most important steps essential to be a hacker. The article will focus on skills and attitude that is required to become a hacker. Breaking the security system and entering into the system is not the only thing a hacker does. A relentless attitude and pristine skill-sets are two cornerstones
for being a master hacker. Knowledge of wide variety of computer science topics is required; however knowing things at great depth is the key to a hacker‘s success. Therefore having a positive attitude toward learning is essential in the journey of learning to become a hacker. Below is the step by step guide I have created to teach you how to be a hacker:
 Step 0: Read The Hacking Manifesto
It is not an easy task to be a hacker. As a hacker, you need to have an attitude and curiosity. Reading the hacking manifesto can teach you the attitude of a hacker. Nurturing the hacker attitude is more about developing competence in the languages rather than having a stereotypical attitude. Though a lot of people consider that a hacker is a criminal; However in real life, they are hired by big companies for protecting information and minimizing potential damage. The act of hacking actually is that of being an over-curious and outwitting authority.
As a hacker, you should be hell-bent on breaching authoritarian rules, secrecy, and censorship. Deception is another arsenal which will allow you to dodge the vigilant eyes of authority. The act of stealing something or doing harm to someone is not hacking. Such people are commonly called crackers in the community. Crackers are involved in illegal activities and I will not recommend you to get involved in such activities.
 Step 1: Learn To Program In C
C programming is one of the most powerful languages in computer programming, it is necessary to really master this language. This programming language was invented by Denise Ritchie in between the years 1969 and 1973 at AT T Bell Labs. C programming will essentially help you divide the task in smaller pieces and these pieces can be expressed by a sequence of commands. Try writing some program on your own by assessing the logic.
There are hundreds of Free C Programming PDF  tutorials available on web to learn, however I would recommend you to start with a simple and well written c programming book of your choice and then read this book (C Programming Language By Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie) to understand the real power of c language. This book is not an easy read however it‘s a must read the book to get an in-depth understanding for C Programming.
 Step 2: Learn More Than One Programming Language
When you are trying to become a hacker, it is very important to learn other modern computer programming languages such as Java, Perl, PHP, and Python. One of the best ways to learn these is by reading books from experts. It will also help to know about markup languages like XML, HTML and data formats such as JSON, Protobuf, and others which are a common way to transfer data between client and server. Java is one of the most popular programming languages. It has been claimed that its also very secure.
Java security model will empower you to understand how this language achieves security. Learn about the security loopholes in Java language and related frameworks. Pick and read from many free PDF, tutorials and eBooks available to learn java online. Perl is a general purpose dynamic programming language, which is a high level and can be interpreted. This language borrows some features of C language. On the other hand, JAVA is concurrent, class-based and objects oriented programming language. Python is really handy when you are trying to automate some repetitive tasks. HTML is the markup language based on which the web pages are designed, created and displayed. The web browsers read the HTML code to display the web page. Python is best language for web development and favorite language of a lot of programmers due to its simplicity and quick turnaround. A lot of people use Python to do simple and complex automation.
 Step 3: Learn UNIX
UNIX is a multi-tasking and multi-user computer operating system that is designed to provide good security to the systems. This operating system was developed by some employees of ATT in Bell Labs. The best way to learn it is to get into an open-source version (e.g. centos) and install/run the same on your own. You can operate internet without learning UNIX, but it is not possible for you to be an internet hacker without understanding UNIX. If you have not used UNIX operating system yet, a few essential Linux commands will make your comfortable in getting quickly started. UNIX in a Nutshell by Arnold Robbins is a good way to start. This book will teach you how to use UNIX. The next thing you need to know is the internals of this operating system. I recommend The Design of the UNIX Operating System by Maurice J. Bach for getting in-depth understanding of UNIX operating system. A large number of web servers are hosted on UNIX based servers and knowing internals of this operating system is going to be really a big boost in your skills.
 Step 4: Learn More Than One Operating Systems
There are many other operating systems apart from UNIX. Windows operating system is one of the most commonly compromised systems; hence it is good to learn hacking Microsoft systems, which are closed-source systems. According to the National Vulnerability Database, Microsoft operating systems have a large number of vulnerabilities. Windows OS installers are distributed in binary; therefore it is not easy for you to read the code. Binary code is basically the digital representation of text and data that computer understands.
However, knowing how programs are written for windows and how different applications behave on this operating system will help. One of the recent vulnerabilities of a popular OS was that Java Web Start applications get launched automatically even if the Java plug-ins are disabled. How to be a hacker is about knowing the weaknesses of these operating systems and targeting them systematically.
 Step 5: Learn Networking Concepts
The networking concept needs to be sharp when you want to be a hacker. Understanding how the networks are created is important, however, you need to know the differences between different
types are networks. Having a clear understanding of TCP/IP and UDP protocol is a must to be able to exploit the vulnerabilities on the World Wide Web. Understand what is subnet, LAN, WAN, and VPN. The networking commands to do an HTTP request needs to be on your fingertips. The HTTP protocol is the gateway through which one enters the internet world. Hence it is necessary to learn this protocol in order to break the barriers. The hackers often use the HTTP gateway to breach the security of the system and take control over it. Apache Httpd is one of the most commonly used web servers and knowing in and out of it is going to empower you on any HTTP or other application layer protocol related endeavors.
Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool that is used by hackers and security professional across the world to identify vulnerable hosts. However, to effectively start using it you must understand the networking basics. To get advanced skills on NMap you can refer the book by creators - Nmap Network Scanning: The Official Nmap Project Guide to Network Discovery and Security Scanning
 Step 6: Start Simple: Read Some Tutorials About Hacking
This is the simple and best way to start. Read as many tutorials as possible that are meant for hacking. These articles will give you insight and help you develop the attitude to be a hacker. Some tutorials will initiate you with Nmap, Nessus and SuperScan, some of the hacking programs or tools that hackers generally use.
 Step 7: Learn Cryptography
As an expert hacker, you need to understand and master the art of cryptography. The technology of cryptography and encryption is very important for internet and networking. It is the practice and study of techniques that are used for secure communication in the presence of third parties. The encryption is done for various aspects of information security such as confidentiality of the data, the integrity of the data and authentication. Moreover, the technology of cryptography is extensively used in ATM cards, computer passwords and e-commerce. While hacking, these encrypted codes need to be broken, which is called decryption.
Cryptography is heavily used in SSL based internet communication. An expert hacker should be able to understand how SSL works and what is the importance of cryptography in keeping SSL secure. Try reading about various encryption algorithms and see why they are difficult to decrypt. Participate in challenges for decrypting powerful encryption. An expert hacker will be able to demonstrate weaknesses in an encryption algorithm and should be able to write a program that can show how decryption can be performed without much information about keys. Understand various techniques used for password cracking. There are dozens of tools available to do password cracking, and using it is not hacking. To be an expert at hacking it‘s important for you to understand how to create a program that can crack a password from ciphertext.
 Step 8: Experiment A Lot
This is an important step for setting yourself up as an expert hacker. Setup a laboratory on your own to experiment the learning on the practical applications. The simplest lab will have your
computer; however, once you advance you may want to add more and more computers and required hardware for your experiments. It is good to try experimenting on your own computers, where you can rectify if you have done any mistake. Many hackers initially start off by downloading virtual lab applications such as Oracle VirtualBox. You require at least 3 GB of RAM and a comparatively powerful processor to carry out your hacking experiments. Setting up the virtual machine is crucial, as it will allow you to test virus, applications, and different servers without affecting your own PC. Some of the things you may need to keep in mind when doing experiments
 Keep a backup before any experiment.
 Start small and have check points.
 Know when to stop.
 Document your progress
 Keep improvising
 Automate repetitive tasks
 Step 9: Read Some Good Books From Experts Reading a lot about anything related is so important in a hackers world that you must also consider enhancing your reading speed. If your reading speed is slow then you may not be able to progress fast in this field. Practice speed reading techniques like skimming, chunk reading, etc. when it comes to reading a lot, its also important to know that a majority of content on the web is not worth your time. Many people use search engine tricks to attract traffic but have little value in it. If you skim thru an article within seconds and decide not to read that is going to save you a lot of time for some really well-researched content. The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson is an excellent book to teach you become an advanced hacker.
 Step 10: Participate In Hacking Challenges
Regular participation in hacking challenges can help you learn more and sharpen your knowledge. There are several companies that organize these challenges in order to check the vulnerability of their software products. The most common hacking challenge includes breaching the security system of the software and taking control of the third party computer systems. Apart from that, there are some websites listed below that regularly offer hacking challenges online.
 hackquest.de
 hacktissite.org
 www.trythis0ne.com
 www.hackchallenge.net
 hacking-lab.com
 Step 11: Go Next Level: Write Vulnerability
The vulnerability of a program is the weakness of the program. It is a good approach to look for the vulnerability of an existing program and share the same with others. In this way you will have the option to collect varied opinions from different sources, enabling you to hone your current skill set. The examples of computer vulnerabilities include memory safety violation, input validation error, privilege confusion bugs and user interface failure. For instance, Microsoft‘s Internet Explorer 11 had the vulnerability bug in its preview version which several hackers exploited. Identifying a new weakness in any software is the real work any expert hackers would perform.
 Step 12: Contribute To Open Source Security Projects
Contributing to an open-source computer security project is a great platform to test your skills. This is not everyone‘s cup of tea. Many organizations like Mozilla and Apache offer these types of open source projects. Try to be a part of these projects and add a valuable contribution to the benefit of the community. Participating in the open source security projects such as anti-spam, anti-virus, firewall and data removals help you augment your dexterity as a hacker. Contribute your vulnerability findings to the global vulnerability databases and give back to the community. Remember that it does not matter if your contribution is small, as long as you participate and add value it helps.
 Step 13: Continue Learning And Keep Listening To Security Talks
The key to success in hacking career is continuous learning. Reading blogs for hacking available at sites such as hackerfactor blog and IKEA hacker blog; participating in the forums such as hackforums.net and elite hack are great ways to refresh your knowledge as a hacker. The online video forums like TED or TechTalk are good sources to know more about the emergent hacking techniques and technologies that are being deployed. You should also try following the posts of famous hackers such as Adrian Lamo, Kevin Mitnick, Kevin Poulsen and Robert Tappan Morris.
 Summary
Above are a few exhaustive steps that can teach you how to be a hacker and help you walk the road of being an expert hacker. However, you should be a responsible citizen and be selective, ensuring you don‘t use this skill to breach the security of important institutions, as it may land you in dire straits. You should always remember, for every hacking tool, there is always a
counter-hacking tool. Therefore, be a smart hacker and more importantly, be a responsible hacker.

    <string name="deep_web_vrs_dark_web">
        Deep web and dark web are so technical in nature that we came across a lot of confusion as to what they actually mean in our research. More tech-savvy publications generally have a disclaimer when discussing the dark web, pleading with their readers that this is not to be confused with the deep web, which is related, but not at all the same thing. So, what exactly are the dark web and the deep web, and why are technology reporters so wary when using either term?
 What is the deep web?
Dictionary.com defines deep web as ―the portion of the Internet that is hidden from conventional search engines, as by encryption; the aggregate of unindexed websites.‖
 What is the dark web?
The dark web, on the other hand, is defined as ―the portion of the Internet that is intentionally hidden from search engines, uses masked IP addresses, and is accessible only with a special web browser: part of the deep web.‖ The key takeaway here is that the dark web is part of the deep web.
 What is Silk Road?
The dark web and the deep web became increasingly common in the news thanks to the heavily reported Silk Road trial. This particular Silk Road is an online black market that was shut down twice by the FBI between 2013 and 2014. In February 2015, Silk Road‘s founder Ross Ulbricht
was convicted of various crimes, including several attempted murders-for-hire. Silk Road ran its operations on the dark web, which makes up a small percentage of the deep web.
What do the dark web and the deep web have in common?
What the dark web and the deep web have in common is that they are both hidden from commercial search engines. You cannot access either from Google or Bing. The deep web is a general, catch-all term that includes the dark web, but also includes ―mundane content like registration-required web forums and dynamically-created pages like your Gmail account,‖ according to Andy Greenberg at Wired. That is to say, most of the deep web is irrelevant to the news stories about Silk Road.
When people discuss the seedy underbelly of the Internet where you can buy drugs, weapons, child pornography, murders-for-hire—basically any illicit item or service you could dream up—that‘s the dark web. Greenberg notes that while the deep web is vast and accounts for 90-something percent of the Internet, the dark web likely only accounts for about .01 percent. The dark web, sometimes referred to as Darknet, is accessed by Tor (The Onion Router) or I2P (Invisible Internet Project), which use masked IP addresses to maintain anonymity for users and site owners. This way, people who use the dark web for illegal purposes can‘t be traced. Who uses the dark web?
The dark web isn‘t all illicit deals and seedy undertakings; it‘s used for an array of purposes. Journalists use the dark web to help protect the anonymity of their sources, and others use the dark web simply because they believe strongly in their right to privacy. Max Eddy for PC Magazine reports that ―Tor was originally developed by the US Department of Defense,‖ and while now Tor is a nonprofit run by volunteers, it is funded by the likes of the US government and the National Science Foundation. On Vox, Timothy B. Lee explains: ―Government support for Tor has continued in recent years as part of the State Department‘s internet freedom agenda, which seeks to help people in repressive regimes gain access to information censored by their governments.‖ For instance, Facebook recently launched a version of its site on the dark web to ―make it easier to access the site from countries that restrict the service, such as China and Iran.‖
 Are the terms the dark web and the deep web interchangeable?
One common misconception about the dark web and the deep web is that these two terms are interchangeable. This is simply not true. Take, for example, this sentence in Business Insider: ―The Dark (or Deep) Web, which refers to areas of the Internet normally inaccessible to users without special anonymizing software, first came to prominence with the Silk Road trial.‖ While, yes, both the deep and dark web have been featured in news stories about Silk Road, this writer is clearly referring specifically to the dark web, which is just a tiny portion of the deep web where users employ masked IP addresses to conceal their identity.
A similar mistake is made by comedian Hannibal Buress in a Funny or Die spoof of the Webby Awards called ―The Deep Webbys.‖ Awards include ―Most Stolen Identity,‖ ―Leakiest Wiki,‖ and ―The People‘s Choice Award for the Trafficking of the Choicest People.‖ Though his delivery is pristine, this is another example of deep web being confused for dark web. The sorts of illegal activities and documents named in these awards are bought, sold, hosted via the dark web. The ―Deep Webbys‖ is too broad a title; the awards should technically be called the ―Dark Webbys,‖ a distinction that Buress, Funny or Die, and the A.V. Club, which reported on Buress‘ video, missed.
The television shows House of Cards, Orphan Black, and Portlandia all recently had plot lines involving the dark web. Did these shows confuse the terms? In House of Cards, as reporter Lucas Goodwin investigates holes in Frank Underwood‘s story, he knows he needs to dig deeper. His more technically inclined coworker explains the deep web to him: ―96 percent of the Internet isn‘t accessible through standard search engines. Most of its useless, but it‘s where you go to find anything and everything. Child porn, Bitcoin laundering, mail-order narcotics, hackers for hire…‖ While this is technically correct, Kim Zetter from Wired told NPR that this is only partially right: ―there should be a distinction between what‘s called the Deep Web and what are known as Darknet sites.‖ Orphan Black makes out a little better. Cal, a tech-startup-wiz turned reclusive lumbersexual, details his efforts to help Sarah and her daughter, saying ―I followed this person on the Darknet, and I saw them asking the same questions as me.‖ This checks out. The dark web and Darknet refer to the same thing. Portlandia, however, straight-up confuses the terms when the Mayor, in an attempt to purchase fireworks for the 4th of July exclaims, ―Man, this deep web has everything! Guns…drugs…explosives!‖ However, the Mayor is not a technical genius, so we can forgive him for his mistake.
 If people keep confusing the terms dark web and deep web, will the definition eventually change and expand?
Will deep web start to mean both the deep web and the dark web, with disambiguation only to be achieved by context? This would not be the first time this sort of thing happened in the English language. Decimate used to describe the ancient Roman practice of killing one out of 10 of a group of mutinous soldiers, as to teach a lesson the remaining troops, but now it more generally means ―to destroy a great number or proportion of something.‖ Those very attached to the older sense can become enraged when they hear the newer sense—and what they consider to be the incorrect sense—used. Is deep web destined to decimate‘s fate?
In Garner‘s Modern American Usage, Bryan Garner advises avoiding “skunked terms” like decimate if we don‘t want to distract readers or listeners who happen to have strong biases either way. Is that what we should do here? Perhaps, though deep web and dark web are still young terms; those who currently confuse the two don‘t have any strong biases either way, so these terms are far from skunked. It‘s possible that, as people become more aware of the different entities they describe, confusion will die down. But is this likely? The deep technical nature of these terms might mean that the majority of English speakers remain forever in the dark.
The dark web is the World Wide Web content that exists on darknets, overlay networks that use the Internet but require specific software, configurations, or authorization to access. The dark
web forms a small part of the deep web, the part of the Web not indexed by web search engines, although sometimes the term deep web is mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark web.
The darknets which constitute the dark web include small, friend-to-friend peer-to-peer networks, as well as large, popular networks like Tor, Freenet, I2P, and Riffle operated by public organizations and individuals. Users of the dark web refer to the regular web as Clearnet due to its unencrypted nature. The Tor dark web may be referred to as onionland, a reference to the networks top-level domain suffix .onion and the traffic anonymization technique of onion routing.

    <string name="what_is_darkweb">
        What is the dark web?
The internet is actually made up of three different layers: the surface web, the deep web and the dark web. The top layer, the surface web, are web pages that show up using search engines such as Google - like The Sun website that youre looking at right now.
The deep webs are web pages which search engines cant access and are therefore hidden, accessed via passwords and authorization. Any time you log into an account youre accessing deep web content that wont show up on a search engine.
For example, work intranets, password-protected areas of online banking and draft blog posts are all stored on the deep web. This means that if someone was to Google your name, your banking information or Amazon wishlist wont show up in the results.
The dark web is a network of untraceable online activity and websites on the internet. They cannot be found using search engines and to access them you need to use specific software,
configurations or have authorization. They are used by lots of different people to keep their web activity hidden.
 Where did the dark web come from?
The dark web was actually created by the US government to allow spies to exchange information completely anonymously. US military researchers developed the technology, known as Tor (The Onion Router) in the mid-1990s and released it into the public domain for everyone to use.
The reason was so that they could stay anonymous - it would be harder to distinguish the governments messages between spies if thousands of other people were using the same system for lots of different things. Tor now hosts roughly 30,000 hidden sites. Its called The Onion Router because it uses the technique of onion routing - making websites anonymous through layers of encryption. Most websites are also hosted on the .onion domain.
 What is the government doing about the dark web?
On April 11, Home Secretary Amber Rudd launched a multi-million pound cyber blitz on criminals selling guns on the dark web. She announced a £9million fund to ensure every police force in the UK has a dedicated cyber-crime unit to bust its "sickening shopping list of services and products".
The extra cash will tackle offenders who are exploiting the anonymity of the dark web - where users use freely available software to avoid being tracked - to trade in guns, drugs and child abuse images. This anonymity has attracted criminals seeking to avoid detection by law enforcement agencies.
 How does the dark web work?
The best explanation so far has been published by Daniel Prince, Associate Director Security at Lancaster University, on The Conversation.
Mr. Prince says: "So just for a minute imagine that the whole internet is a forest – a vast expanse of luscious green as far as the eye can see. And in the forest are well-worn paths – to get from A to B.
"Think of these paths as popular search engines – like Google – allowing you as the user the option to essentially see the wood from the trees and be connected. But away from these paths – and away from Google – the trees of the forest mask your vision.
"Off the paths it is almost impossible to find anything – unless you know what you‘re looking for – so it feels a bit like a treasure hunt. Because really the only way to find anything in this vast forest is to be told where to look.
"This is how the dark web works – and it is essentially the name given to all the hidden places on the internet.
"Just like the forest, the dark web hides things well – it hides actions and it hides identities. The dark web also prevents people from knowing who you are, what you are doing and where you are doing it."
 Who uses the dark web and why?
The dark web is used by all sorts of people for all sorts of reasons - but its not surprising that its used for illegal activity. A study by the University of Portsmouth in 2014 found that the most wanted type of content on Tor was child porn, followed by black markets for goods such as drugs, personal details and even guns.
This type of site is regularly busted by police, who compromise them by distributing viruses and malware to users. The dark web is also used for hiding online activity related to finance, extremism, arms, hacking, abuse and fraud. However, for others the dark web has positive uses. For example, it can be used to avoid a national firewall, such as China, where users are normally blocked from accessing hidden sites.
It can also be used as a tool for whistleblowing - infamous website WikiLeaks is hosted on the dark web, allowing whistleblowers to anonymously upload classified information to the press.
 Do police ever catch people using the dark web?
Yes - although using the dark web makes it easier to evade detection but governments around the world are working to index, sort and catalogue the dark web as well as monitor it as much as they can.
What is the Dark Web? How to Access it secretly (10 Simple Steps) By Tarquin.
Are you trying to find out how to access the dark web and what is it? Well, look no further, we have gone and done the research so we could show you step by step the best and safest way how to access the dark net. We cover everything, from setting up Tor, how to choose a VPN, what not to do, finding the best sites to access, and extra steps to remain anonymous. It is extremely easy to access the dark web and even easier to be detected on it if you don‘t take precautions. If you are new to the darknet, this guide will help you on your way. According to researchers, only 4% of the internet is visible to the general public. Meaning that the remaining 96% of the internet is made up of ―The Deep Web‖.
Dark Web or Dark Net is a subset of the Deep Web where there are sites that sell drugs, hacking software, counterfeit money and more. We explain this further down the article if you are not up to speed.
If you are looking to access hidden marketplace‘s or darknet websites (with a .onion domain) then dark web access is done using the TOR network with the TOR browser bundle. TOR is the most widely used dark web browser. How To Access The Dark Web Guide
Step 1: Go and get yourself a good VPN (Virtual Private Network) here , use it ALL of the time, no matter if you are on TOR or not. This site here reviews the best VPN‘s for use with TOR. You should be taking your anonymity and security very seriously if you are visiting the Dark Net, especially if you are viewing any Darknet Markets.
Do not fool yourself and think that the ISP‘s (Internet Service Providers) and Law Enforcement are not trying to track those who use Tor to access the Dark Web, they are, and they are good at it so don‘t make it easy for them. It should be brought to your attention that there was a recent Tor vulnerability which leaked your REAL IP address leading back to your real location. If you already have the Tor Browser then UPDATE it immediately. Vulnerabilities like these are happening more often to Tor.
By using the simple VPN app, your darknet activities will be hidden from your ISP and government agencies as all of your internet usage will be encrypted. No one will even know you are using TOR, let alone browsing for darknet markets. What‘s even better is that the VPN will give you a fake IP address, in another country if you like, so even if Tor is compromised then the trace just leads back to somewhere else that can‘t be linked to you. The other benefit of using a VPN is to prevent hackers stealing your identity and or personal files and photos from your computer.
You need to use a good VPN that keeps NO LOGS, fast performance, preferably accepts bitcoin as payment, has a kill switch for DNS leaks, and is compatible with TOR. Then install your VPN, if you buy one of the better VPN‘s then it is usually just a one click install and one or two clicks to turn it on.
Step 2: You can‘t access the deepweb just using a common browser like Internet Explorer or Google Chrome. To get dark net access you will need to download the dark web browser called TOR browser bundle. Only get it from the official TOR website, never download it from anywhere else!
Now close all of your browsing windows and all apps connecting to the World Wide Web like Google Drive, Skype, OneDrive, iCloud etc. Then open your VPN app and connect to another location other than where you are at, make sure to use the OpenVPN protocol as it is the most secure. Open up your normal favorite browser and then download TOR.
Step 3: Install the TOR browser bundle on your PC or Mac. When the download is complete, double-click the downloaded file, choose the destination folder (the folder where you want to extract tor browser), and choose extract.
Step 4: Start TOR Browser. Open the folder where you extracted TOR browser and double-click ―Start Tor Browser‖. The TOR start page will open in a browser window (it‘s actually a portable version of Firefox stripped down). From here, you now have a good level of anonymity and security and you are able to gain access to .onion websites through your dark web browser.
Congratulations…
Next, you will want to visit a dark web site. Darknet Market List so you can visit some of the best black market websites on the Deep Web.
 Silk Road ( Dark web screenshot ) If you do want to check out some darknet markets then you should follow the guide for that specific market as it will show you step by step what to do to sign up, browse etc. If you are looking for the biggest list of hidden deep
web links go here so you can find exactly what you are looking for. (Some also call them dark web links). We have compiled one of the biggest lists of tested .onion sites on the dark net complete with a search function, website name, description, categories, site status and even a screenshot of the landing page so you can see if your site is online or dead.
Now we have shown you how to access the dark web we have some very important tips to share.
 Bitcoin and Buying on the Dark Web:
If you are on the dark net to buy something, and most of us are, then you will need to use cryptocurrency to do so and Bitcoin is the most used cryptocurrency on the dark web. Buying cryptocurrencies is another topic altogether, so we won‘t go into it here but this APP has made an easy to follow guide on buying bitcoin, but we will give you one GOLDEN tip on how to go under the radar and not have your crypto exchange account shut down and lose money.
NEVER send cryptocurrency directly from your exchange account (where you buy the coins) to a market or anywhere on the dark web, also never send coins directly from anywhere on the dark net to your exchange. They are onto this right away as they can tell where the coins came from and they WILL shut you down and you will be recorded in a list for sure. You must send your coins from your exchange to a wallet (find out how to in the guides) then from the wallet to the dark web and vice-versa.
 Hacking on the Dark Web:
There are a lot of dark web users that are hackers and there are even more users that want to become hackers. The dark web is the hacker‘s playground, so if you don‘t know what you are doing then you need to be extra careful and take the precautions we mention very seriously, like using a VPN, covering your webcam, using very good usernames and passwords etc.
The hacking course will teach you tons of things like:
 Penetration testing
 Create fake Wi-Fi Networks
 Crack WEP/WPAWPA2 encryptions
 Launch man in the middle attacks
 Gain control over other computer systems
 Backdoor programs
 Exploit vulnerabilities
 ARP Spoofing/ARP Poisoning
 And much much more.
Bonus Security Steps For the Dark Net:
Step 5: DO NOT change the TOR browser window size unless you like living dangerously. The FEDS have programs that can match identities on random things such and matching time online and other things with the browser window size, I shit you not. If you don‘t change the size then it is the same as most other people.
Step 6: Please remember that TOR isn‘t necessarily 100% anonymous, you should turn off JavaScript within the dark web browser settings to help.
Block JavaScript in TOR Browser
Step 7: Disconnect your webcam or block the camera with some black tape. Hackers and governments have ways of getting into your computer and turning on the video and cameras. You can have intimate images of you be used as blackmail or extortion, or even worse, used by the feds.
Step 7: Disconnect your webcam or block the camera with some black tape. Hackers and governments have ways of getting into your computer and turning on the video and cameras. You can have intimate images of you be used as blackmail or extortion, or even worse, used by the feds.
Covered camera and mic?
Step 8: Disconnect your microphone or cover it with tape to muffle it good. The same goes for the microphone as the camera, the last thing you want is to be recorded saying incriminating things at home. It doesn‘t even have to be while on the dark net. Even the Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg does it as he knows the dangers.
Step 9: NEVER use your real name, photos, email, or even password that you have used before on the dark web. This is the fastest way to be tracked. Use an anonymous email account and aliases that have nothing to do with you that you have never used before.
Step 10: If you are using TOR on the dark web for anything other than looking at cute pictures of kittens, you should think seriously about your privacy and security. If you have read through this how to access the darknet guide and thought to yourself? Then you are probably new to this and need a bit of background and information to get you up to speed. Please remember to ask your friends and families to download this APP so everyone that wants to have a look on the Dark Web can do so and do it safely.

        What is the Clear Web? (Surface Web)
Firstly, there is the Clear Web/Clear Net/Surface Web. This is the normal internet / World Wide Web where you do everyday things like check Gmail, Facebook, and Twitter and buy things from Amazon etc. All websites and web pages that a search engine like Google can find are on the Clear Net. What is the Deep Web?
Then we have the Deep Web. This is a sub-set of the internet that cannot be indexed (found) by search engines like Google. This includes all web pages that are behind membership logins, all company and organization web pages used internally and other data. The majority of the deepweb does not have anything illegal on it.
Deep Web and Dark Web
What is the Dark Web (also called dark net)?
Dark web is the part of the internet where websites exist in an encrypted network accessible only via TOR. Websites on the Dark Web cannot be found using traditional search engines nor can be accessed using traditional web browsers.
It is a sub-set of the Deep Web that contains all sorts of websites, both legal and illegal. The types of sites include black markets that sell things like drugs, counterfeit goods, and weapons; you also have hacking sites, X-rated sites, bitcoin tumbling, and even sites for hitmen. The variety of sites on the Dark Web is quite astonishing. For now there is no dark web search engine that works as well as Google does for the clearnet.

        How Do Hackers Get Into Computer Systems?
In the computer world, there are good guys who create networks that help us communicate, work with others and get information...and then there are those not-so-good guys and girls who, for a variety of reasons, like to use their computers to worm their way into those networks and cause trouble.
Theyre called hackers, and theyll routinely do things like:
 Steal secrets.
 Obtain passwords.
 Get credit card information.
 Create so much traffic that a website has to shut down.
Hackers are ALWAYS at work, either trying to steal information for their own gain or disrupt business as usual. You hear a lot of about hackers on the news now and then, but just what are they doing?
Heres a bit of background to help you understand what it means when a website or company is "hacked."
 Hackers arent heroes.
For some reason, there are those who think that hackers are "cool" and that their spirit of mischief and sneaking is admirable. But the IT (Internet technology) experts who spend a lot of money building business or government networks would disagree. And, for that matter, so would anyone who has ever had their money or identity stolen by a hacker. Theres nothing playful about that.
Most people would agree that there are three types of hackers:
1. Young kids "having fun." These are adolescents who are essentially vandals on the Internet and are also known as Script Kiddies. Theyre not looking for more than a few hours of their fun messing with websites or networks.
2. Recreational "hackers." These are savvy computer users who intrude on networks when they feel they have a valid reason to...in their minds at least. They may have a grudge against a certain website or company and take their dislike out by "hacking" or disrupting the website.
3. Professionals. When a computer expert gets a taste of hacking and likes the flavor, he or she will continue to use their skill, often for breaking into peoples accounts to steal money. They also might like taking down a big network for "fun."
 Stealing passwords and getting in the system.
Finding out a password is the usually the first step in cracking a networks security. (Thats why there are so many articles telling you to change your passwords often and make them hard to figure out!)
Here are a few key terms that youll hear in discussions about hackers and what they do:
 Back door. A secret pathway a hacker uses to gain entry to a computer system.
 Buffer overflow. A method of attack where the hacker delivers malicious commands to a system by overrunning an application buffer.
 Denial-of-service attack. An attack designed to cripple the victims system by preventing it from handling its normal traffic, usually by flooding it with false traffic.
 Email worm. A virus-laden script or mini-program sent to an unsuspecting victim through a normal-looking email message.
 Root access. The highest level of access (and most desired by serious hackers) to a computer system, which can give them complete control over the system.
 Root kit. A set of tools used by an intruder to expand and disguise his control of the system.
 Script kiddie. A young or unsophisticated hacker who uses base hacker tools to try to act like a real hacker.
 Session hijacking. When a hacker is able to insert malicious data packets right into an actual data transmission over the Internet connection.
 Trojan horse. A seemingly helpful program that tricks the computer user into opening it, only to deliver (unnoticed and behind the scenes) an unexpected attack on the users computer.
 Keeping safe.
You can protect yourself simply by creating passwords that are hard to predict, by using different passwords for different accounts, and by changing passwords every so often.
These steps help to prevent you from being an "easy" target.
 Many of my aspiring hackers have written to me asking the same thing. "What skills do I need to be a good hacker?"
As the hacker is among the most skilled information technology disciplines, it requires a wide knowledge of IT technologies and techniques. To truly be a great hacker, one must master many
skills. Dont be discouraged if you dont have all the skills I list here, but rather use this list as a starting ground for what you need to study and master in the near future.
This is my overview list of required skills to enter the pantheon of this elite IT profession. Ive broken the skills into three categories to help you go from one rung to the other more easily—fundamental, intermediate, and intangible skills—and have included links to related articles on Null Byte for you to get acquainted with.
    </string>

    <string name="fundamental_skills">
        The Fundamental Skills
These are the basics that every hacker should know before even trying to hack. Once you have a good grasp on everything in this section, you can move into the intermediary level.
1. Basic Computer Skills
It probably goes without saying that to become a hacker you need some basic computer skills. These skills go beyond the ability to create a Word document or cruise the Internet. You need to be able to use the command line in Windows, edit the registry, and set up your networking parameters.
Many of these basic skills can be acquired in a basic computer skills course like A+.
2. Networking Skills
You need to understand the basics of networking, such as the following.
 DHCP
 NAT
 Subnetting
 IPv4
 IPv6
 Public v Private IP
 DNS
 Routers and switches
 VLANs
 OSI model
 MAC addressing
 ARP
As we are often exploiting these technologies, the better you understand how they work, the more successful you will be. Note that I did not write the two guides below, but they are very informative and cover some of the networking basics mentioned above.
 Hacker Fundamentals: A Tale of Two Standards
 The Everymans Guide to How Network Packets Are Routed
3. Linux Skills
It is extremely critical to develop Linux skills to become a hacker. Nearly all the tools we use as a hacker are developed for Linux and Linux gives us capabilities that we dont have using Windows.
If you need to improve your Linux skills, or youre just getting started with Linux, check out my Linux series for beginners below.
 Linux Basics for the Aspiring Hacker
4. Wireshark or Tcpdump
Wireshark is the most widely used sniffer/protocol analyzer, while tcpdump is a command line sniffer/protocol analyzer. Both can be extraordinarily useful in analyzing TCP/IP traffic and attacks.
 An Intro to Wireshark and the OSI Model
 Wireshark Filters for Wiretappers
5. Virtualization
You need to become proficient in using one of the virtualization software packages such as VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation. Ideally, you need a safe environment to practice your hacks before you take them out in real world. A virtual environment provides you a safe environment to test and refine your hacks before going live with them.
6. Security Concepts  Technologies
A good hacker understands security concepts and technologies. The only way to overcome the roadblocks established by the security admins is to be familiar with them. The hacker must understand such things as PKI (public key infrastructure), SSL (secure sockets layer), IDS (intrusion detection system), firewalls, etc.
The beginner hacker can acquire many of these skills in a basic security course such as Security+.
 How to Read  Write Snort Rules to Evade an IDS
7. Wireless Technologies
In order to be able to hack wireless, you must first understand how it works. Things like the encryption algorithms (WEP, WPA, and WPA2), the four-way handshake, and WPS. In addition, understanding such as things as the protocol for connection and authentication and the legal constraints on wireless technologies.
To get started, check out my guide below on getting started with wireless terms and technologies, and then read our collection of Wi-Fi hacking guides for further information on each kind of encryption algorithms and for examples of how each hack works.
 Getting Started with Wi-Fi Terms  Technologies
 The Aspiring Hackers Guide to Hacking Wi-Fi The Intermediate Skills
This is where things get interesting, and where you really start to get a feel for your capabilities as a hacker. Knowing all of these will allow you to advance to more intuitive hacks where you are calling all the shots—not some other hacker.
8. Scripting
Without scripting skills, the hacker will be relegated to using other hackers tools. This limits your effectiveness. Every day a new tool is in existence loses effectiveness as security admins come up with defenses.
To develop your own unique tools, you will need to become proficient at least in one of the scripting languages including the BASH shell. These should include one of Perl, Python, or Ruby.
 Perl Scripting for the Aspiring Hacker
 Scripting for the Aspiring Hacker, Part 1: BASH Basics
 Scripting for the Aspiring Hacker, Part 2: Conditional Statements
 Scripting for the Aspiring Hacker, Part 3: Windows PowerShell
 The Ultimate List of Hacking Scripts for Metasploits Meterpreter
9. Database Skills
If you want to be able to proficiently hack databases, you will need to understand databases and how they work. This includes the SQL language. I would also recommend the mastery of one of the major DBMSs such SQL Server, Oracle, or MySQL.
 The Terms  Technologies You Need to Know Before Getting Started
 Hunting for Microsofts SQL Server
 Cracking SQL Server Passwords  Owning the Server
 Hacking MySQL Online Databases with Sqlmap
 Extracting Data from Online Databases Using Sqlmap
10. Web Applications
Web applications are probably the most fertile ground for hackers in recent years. The more you understand about how web applications work and the databases behind them, the more successful you will be. In addition, you will likely need to build your own website for phishing and other nefarious purposes.
 How to Clone Any Website Using HTTrack
 How to Redirect Traffic to a Fake Website
11. Forensics
To become good hacker, you must not be caught! You cant become a pro hacker sitting in a prison cell for 5 years. The more you know about digital forensics, the better you can become at avoiding and evading detection.
 Digital Forensics, Part 1: Tools  Techniques
 Digital Forensics, Part 2: Network Forensics
 Digital Forensics, Part 3: Recovering Deleted Files
 Digital Forensics, Part 4: Evading Detection While DoSing
12. Advanced TCP/IP
The beginner hacker must understand TCP/IP basics, but to rise to the intermediate level, you must understand in intimate details the TCP/IP protocol stack and fields. These include how each of the fields (flags, window, df, tos, seq, ack, etc.) in both the TCP and IP packet can be manipulated and used against the victim system to enable MitM attacks, among other things.
13. Cryptography
Although one doesnt need to be a cryptographer to be a good hacker, the more you understand the strengths and weaknesses of each cryptographic algorithm, the better the chances of defeating it. In addition, cryptography can use by the hacker to hide their activities and evade detection.
14. Reverse Engineering
Reverse engineering enables you to open a piece of malware and re-build it with additional features and capabilities. Just like in software engineering, no one builds a new application from scratch. Nearly every new exploit or malware uses components from other existing malware.
In addition, reverse engineering enables the hacker to take an existing exploit and change its signature so that it can fly past IDS and AV detection.
 How to Change Metasploit Payload Signatures to Evade AV Detection The Intangible Skills
Along with all these computer skills, the successful hacker must have some intangible skills. These include the following.
15. Think Creatively
There is ALWAYS a way to hack a system and many ways to accomplish it. A good hacker can think creatively of multiple approaches to the same hack.
 Null Bytes Guide to Social Engineering
 CryptoLocker: An Innovative  Creative Hack
16. Problem-Solving Skills
A hacker is always coming up against seemingly unsolvable problems. This requires that the hacker be accustomed to thinking analytically and solving problems. This often demands that the hacker diagnose accurately what is wrong and then break the problem down into separate components. This is one of those abilities that come with many hours of practice.
 Problem Solving Is an Essential Hacker Skill
17. Persistence
A hacker must be persistent. If you fail at first, try again. If that fails, come up with a new approach and try again. It is only with persistence that you will be able to hack the most secured systems.
 So...You Want to Be a Hacker?
I hope this gives you some guidelines as to what one needs to study and master to ascend to the intermediate level of hacking. In a future article, Ill discuss what you need to master to ascend into the advanced or master hacker level, so keep coming back, my novice hackers!

        How to Access the Dark Web: Browsing Dark Web, TOR Browser, and .Onion Websites by: Timothy Shim
The World Wide Web, much like real life, is so massive that it would take you a lifetime to traverse every nook and cranny. To compound that fact, by the time you were halfway done, so much more content would have been created and updated that you‘d have to start all over again.
All of this is well known, but how many of you are aware that the content you usually encounter on the web is barely the tip of a massive iceberg of information?
 Imagine a real iceberg
The top protrudes above the water and is visible, yet the real bulk of the iceberg is below that, unseen. The World Wide Web is similar, in which the regular sites we visit are the top of that iceberg. This includes common sites such as Wikipedia, Google and even the millions of blogs that come and go daily.
Beneath the water lurks the deep and dark, hidden from view for various reasons, the Dark Web. Less nefarious is the information that skims the surface of the Dark Web, in a zone called the Deep Web. Those belong to large corporates or governments and are never exposed to the public, such as medical records, government reports, and financial records and such. These are kept away from search engines and behind powerful firewalls to protect them.
It‘s truly in the depths of the of the dark web that things get shady – and oftentimes dangerous.
The web is much more than meets the eye, there’s tons of it that is hidden
Why is the Dark Web hidden?
In the case of the deep web, since personal records, government documents and such are not meant for public view in the first place, those are understandably kept safe. However, they still are mostly connected to the Internet since much of that information forms an ecosystem for many surface web applications.
The Dark Web is slightly more complicated. This part of the World Wide Web is often run on networks of private servers, allowing communication only via specific means. This enables a high degree of anonymity and makes it difficult for authorities to shut down. Unfortunately, this has led to Dark Web to become a place where many illegal activities take place. What’s hidden in the Dark Web?
If you‘ve ever heard of cybercrime, you‘ll probably know that the cybercriminals of today are after more than just money. They take literally anything of value, which means credit card information, personal information and more. All of these things are commodities on the Dark Web, to be bought, sold or traded.
Aside from that, there are also business dealings that are illegal and can‘t be conducted on the surface web. Almost anything can be bought on the Dark Web – for a price. The items available can include firearms, illegal drugs, illegal wildlife, or even the rental of a hitman! Finally, there is the most depraved and undesirable of all – those who deal in the sickest and most perverse types of pornography, which is illegal, is almost every part of the world. Even the advertising you‘ll see while browsing the Dark Web will be different. Here you might even find Guns R Us!
How to Access Dark Web Websites
! Warning!
Before proceeding further, it is important that you understand that many things on the Dark Web are highly illegal. No matter what precautions you take, being able to stay anonymous is highly unlikely. Enter at your own risk!
1. Download and install the TOR browser
Despite its current usage as a browser that is often used to access parts of the Dark Web, TOR (aka. the dark web browser) was originally developed to help safeguard U.S. Intelligence online communication.
Today, it is one of the few ways to access .onion websites, which are located on the Dark Web.
TOR is a version of the popular Firefox web browser, modified to allow users to browse the web anonymously. The browser is designed to block or advise against user attempts to do things that might reveal their identity, such as resizing the dimensions of the browser window, for example. While you‘re waiting for TOR to download, take the time to stick a piece of dark tape over your webcam lens. You never know what might happen.
And also – check out the following introduction video by TOR.
<span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">?</span>
2. Consider paying for a Virtual Private Network service
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are servers that you connect through to access the web. These servers help to mask your origin and may emulate locations from many other places in the world. Although TOR masks your identity, it does not hide your location.
For those who have not used a VPN service before, you might like to try out how it works before paying for one. Kaspersky has a free version that allows 200MB of data usage per month. If you don‘t mind paying, ExpressVPN and NordVPN exceed most other paid VPN services in my opinion.
3. DuckDuckGo is your friend
Navigating the Dark Web is slightly different. Remember the phase that often tossed about: ‗Google is your friend’? Well, Google doesn’t index sites on the Dark Web, so there; your best friend will be DuckDuckGo, which does a similar job.
4. Sign up for a secure email address
Now that you‘re ready to go, it‘s time to sign up for an untraceable email address. Gmail is out of the question, and you‘ll need an email address to register for many .onion websites.
Here are a few that you might like to consider:
 ProtonMail
 TORbox
 Mail2Tor
Note that these come with .onion domains as well, which you need to access using the TOR browser. Regular browsers like Chrome and Firefox will not work.
5. Dark web search engine
.onion is a domain exclusively used on the Dark Web. These are similar to regular domains, but cannot be accessed without a specialized browser like TOR. Here are a couple of relatively harmless .onion addresses that you can try out:
 DuckDuckGo Search Engine
 eBooks
There are huge lists of .onion websites available and it only takes a little effort to find them. Again, bear in mind that you may bump into strange (and again, highly illegal) things on the Dark Web.
Screenshot of a dark web site. Something you can expect to see at any time on the Dark Web – seized websites.
How safe is it to play in the Dark Web?
It sounds exotic and there is that thrill of the unknown and unexplored, but much likes the deep blue sea, many dangers are hidden. As the average run of-the-mill Joe (or Jill, as the case may be), how safe is it to explore the dark web?
Although there are truly exotic things on the dark web that you would not normally see, along with even some of the more mundane albeit in anonymous form (for you), the dark web isn‘t a place for you to blindly stumble about.
There are very bad things and people around that running into could result in serious consequences for you. This applies not only to bad guys, but there is also a very real chance of problems with law enforcement, depending on what you do.
In case you‘re not convinced, here are some examples of what goes on in the dark web and the consequences;
 Drug Distribution Earlier this year, a couple in the US was charged for selling drugs under the dark web vendor handle of MH4Life on various trade sites. They were using the dark web to sell Fentanyl, a type of opioid which is frequently abused as a recreational drug as well as other illicit substances. The pair was arrested despite using cryptocurrency, virtual private networks and proxies as well as other elaborate distraction techniques.
 Guns, Gold and Cash
More than 35 people in New York and California were arrested by a combined-agency task force for selling contraband on the dark web. Among items seized were more than 100 guns, $3.6 million in cash and 2,000 Bitcoins.
 Kidnapping  Sex Trafficking
A Polish man was planning to sell a kidnapped British model on the dark web. When plans went awry, he was arrested in Italy where his victim claimed that he boasted of earning more than $17 million selling kidnapped women on the dark web.
    </string>

    <string name="dark_web_security_guide">
        Dark Web Security Guide
Since we‘ve established that there are some truly terrifying things happening on the dark web, let‘s look at some ways you can avoid them, if you really insist on peeking;
1- Make sure your Tor browser is up to date
Using the Tor browser is necessary to visit .onion sites, but every application has the occasional weakness. Always ensure that your Tor browser is kept up to date and try to stay abreast of vulnerability notices.
2- Use a reputable VPN
As I‘ve mentioned, the use of a VPN is highly recommended – they help keep your identity safe and protect all data that‘s being sent to and from your device. But make sure the VPN you‘re using meets a few basic criteria.
For starters, you‘ll want to choose one which is based out of a country without strict data retention laws, like NordVPN which is based in Panama or ExpressVPN out of the British Virgin Islands.
3- Stop using Macros
Macros and apps which run scripts like JavaScript open a whole new can of worms and raise your risk profile considerably. Some normal sites like YouTube need them, but if a site on the dark web is asking you to enable scripts, think twice. You will be at high risk of virus or Malware infections.
4- Watch what you download
The logic is like the above, to avoid Virus and Malware, but please watch what you download on the dark web. Remember, malicious code can be embedded in almost any file type and you won‘t know until it‘s too late. If you must, use a virtual machine to do so, as this will isolate the file form the rest of your OS.
5- Change your mindset
Many people browse the web daily with abandon and even with increased cyber threats today, there is still the mindset that the web is a safe place to just stumble around. Browsing the dark web with this mindset could be fatal. Always be security conscious and aware. Trust no one.
There are a ton of other things you should take note of, but here‘s one final tip – Be cautious of making friends on the dark web, it‘s not Facebook. Playing the tourist on the Dark Web
For those who may be a little faint of heart and yet have stuck with me until this point, here‘s the ‗safe‘ tour.
This section will give you a couple of nice places to visit. Once you‘re done with these, you can then burn your laptop and wash your hands with industrial-strength detergent before moving to Nome, Alaska
1- The Hidden Wiki
This is a fantastic site to visit if you‘re really new to the Dark Web. Much like the real Wikipedia, The Hidden Wiki has tons of information and links you can jump through to really get to know the Dark Web. It is one of the stalwarts among .onions and doubtless will remain so for many years to come.
2- The Hidden Wallet
Knowing that there are tons of things you can buy here, you‘ll probably know you have to pay for it as well. This site is sort of like a digital wallet and allows you to transact in Bitcoins. The big difference though is that most digital wallet sites are not anonymous and many even have to comply with financial regulations as well. The Hidden Wallet is… well, hidden.
3- Dream Market
Now you have a way to sign up for things (anonymous email) and also pay for them (anonymous Bitcoin), wander over to Dream Market and browse the goods. This is one of the smaller .onion marketplaces and that‘s probably why they are still in operation. The FBI has been conducting sweeps across the Dark Web to stamp out illegal trade and many famous marketplaces such as Silk Road have gone under.
4- Facebook
It‘s really strange that the world‘s largest social media platform would have a .onion address, but there you are, Facebook it is. This part of Facebook was supposedly developed by them to cater
to those who want a social network that‘s anonymous. I‘m not quite sure how ‗anonymous‘ and ‗social‘ work together, but the .onion Facebook claims not to keep logs of user activity.
5- Private Hosting
Don‘t trust your local web hosting company or are getting sick of user agreements?
Not to worry, the Dark Web has something for every paranoid being on earth! Private Hosting offers secured and anonymous web hosting. You can have a Linux-based PHP site of up to 100MB and unlimited bandwidth for only US$170 a year!
6- Buy Bitcoins at Blockchain
Bitcoins help you remain anonymous, so it‘s great for Tor users. So why not access this site directly via a .onion link? What makes this site more unique than some others is that it has a HTTPS certificate for its .onion address!
7- Report Oppressive Policing
You‘ve heard of the term whistleblower? That when people report on the misdoings of others, usually a large corporate. So why not have a site for reporting on excessive policing or surveillance? With the help of Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights, Netpoleaks allows anyone to stay anonymous and submit sensitive information.
8- Torch
Just as Google has its competitors so dues DuckDuckGO (although I love that name!). TORCH is a very simple and minimalistic search engine you can try out of you every get sick of the friendly duck.
9- Tor Shops
Tor Shops is the website builder for dark web. Create your own .onion web store with Tor Shops and they even come with Bitcoin integration! From as low as $100 in setup fees, you can have your own web store on the dark web – just pay a fraction of your income from the store.
10- Rent-A-Hacker
Ever wanted to hack the heck out of someone who pissed you off but have no idea how? Rent a hacker today. This apparent freelancer is selling serious hacking services – if you‘re willing to pay a price. Prices start from around 250 Euros for small time hacking like email or Facebook accounts.
11- Apples 4 Bitcoin
Ever wanted an iPhone of Macbook but insisted on paying in Bitcoin? There‘s an option here for you as well, but model types and numbers are limited. All phones come factory unlocked and can work anywhere in the world.
12- The Campfire
Go back to the days of Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and you‘ll meet The Campfire, its modern incarnation. This English-language site offers chatrooms and brands itself as the virtual gather-round-the-campfire-and-chat place.
It‘s meant to be family-friendly, so no trolling for porn, sex, drugs or other weird .onion stuff here please!
13- Bitmessage
If you‘re looking for a no-frills email service provider that is exactly the opposite of Gmail, Bitmessage is there for you. It‘s free and doesn‘t bombard you with ads and does not track you with Google Analytics or the like.
You‘ll get an email address to use and in fact, you can use this on the open web as well. Most people of course come here with the comfort of Tor to make use of their hidden service. It has many features similar to a lot of other open web mail service providers.
14- ESCROW Service
If you‘re looking for a safe (?) way to trade on the Internet, have no fear, there are also options for you. Much like the way a lawyer can hold funds in escrow, so you ESCROW service. It even deals in Bitcoin so that everything is anonymous.
Trade to your heart‘s content and all they ask is a modest 1.5% transaction fee. They will make sure you can inspect the shipped items before releasing your funds and offer third party dispute resolution in case the deal sours.

15– SecureDrop
Everyone needs some space on the web sometimes and SecureDrop is exactly that. However, it‘s a little more as week, since it was designed to allow whistle blowers a way to submit stuff to media companies anonymously. Interestingly, this site is now owned and operated by Freedom of the Press Foundation. All data is encrypted and there are no third-party connections anywhere in the process. It‘s really completely anonymous!

        Wrapping Up
If you‘ve tested some the stuff in this article out, by now you‘ve probably realized that what I‘ve given you is a highly sanitized version of what‘s really available on the Dark Web. Seriously, some of the things are so illegal that I won‘t even type them out here.
The Dark Web can be a place of real freedom. For example, you can openly discuss anything political, no matter how left or right wing, without fear of prosecution from your local authorities. Unfortunately, that‘s intermixed with a lot of, well, not so nice things.
Enjoy the freedom but always remember, if you try to stay anonymous but still get caught, you WILL be charged for whatever illegal activities you have partaken in on the Dark Web. After all, they even caught Saddam Hussein, didn‘t they?

    <string name="intro_microsoft_office">
        Microsoft Office (or simply Office) is a family of client software, server software, and services developed by Microsoft. It was first announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an office suite (bundled set of productivity applications), the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand.
On July 10, 2012, Softpedia reported that Office is used by over a billion people worldwide. Office is produced in several versions targeted towards different end-users and computing environments. The original, and most widely used version, is the desktop version, available for PCs running the Windows and macOS operating systems. Office Online is a version of the software that runs within a web browser, while Microsoft also maintains Office apps for Android and iOS. Since Office 2013, Microsoft has promoted Office 365 as the primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows use of the software and other services on a subscription business model, and users receive free feature updates to the software for the lifetime of the subscription, including new features and cloud computing integration that are not necessarily included in the "on-premises" releases of Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017, revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license sales. The current on-premises, desktop version of Office is Office 2019, released on September 24, 2018.

         Desktop applications
Unless stated otherwise, desktop applications are available for Windows and macOS.
 Microsoft Word: a word processor included in Microsoft Office and some editions of the now-discontinued Microsoft Works. The first version of Word, released in the autumn of 1983, was for the MS-DOS operating system and introduced the Computer mouse to more users. Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse, though none was required. Following the precedents of LisaWrite and MacWrite, Word for Macintosh attempted to add closer WYSIWYG features into its package. Word for Mac was released in 1985. Word for Mac was the first graphical version of Microsoft Word. Initially, it implemented the proprietary .doc format as its primary format. Word 2007, however, deprecated this format in favor of Office Open XML, which was later standardized by Ecma International as an open format. Support for Portable Document Format (PDF) and Open Document (ODF) was first introduced in Word for Windows with Service Pack 2 for Word 2007.
 Microsoft Excel: a spreadsheet editor that originally competed with the dominant Lotus 1-2-3, and eventually outsold it. Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Mac OS in 1985, and the first Windows version (numbered 2.05 to line up with the Mac) in November 1987.
 Microsoft PowerPoint: a presentation program used to create slideshows composed of text, graphics, and other objects, which can be displayed on-screen and shown by the presenter or printed out on transparencies or slides.
 Microsoft Access: a database management system for Windows that combines the relational Microsoft Jet Database Engine with a graphical user interface and software development tools. Microsoft Access stores data in its own format based on the Access Jet Database Engine. It can also import or link directly to data stored in other applications and databases.
 Microsoft Outlook (not to be confused with Outlook Express, Outlook.com or Outlook on the web): a personal information manager that replaces Windows Messaging, Microsoft Mail, and Schedule+ starting in Office 97, it includes an e-mail client, calendar, task manager and address book. On the Mac OS, Microsoft offered several versions of Outlook in the late 1990s, but only for use with Microsoft Exchange Server.
In Office 2001, it introduced an alternative application with a slightly different feature set called Microsoft Entourage. It reintroduced Outlook in Office 2011, replacing Entourage.
 Microsoft OneNote: a note taking program that gathers handwritten or typed notes, drawings, screen clippings and audio commentaries. Notes can be shared with other OneNote users over the Internet or a network. OneNote was initially introduced as a standalone app that was not included in any of Microsoft Office 2003 editions. However, OneNote eventually became a core component of Microsoft Office; with the release of Microsoft Office 2013, OneNote was included in all Microsoft Office offerings. OneNote is also available as a web app on Office Online, a freemium (and later freeware) Windows desktop app, a mobile app for Windows Phone, iOS, Android, and Symbian, and a Metro-style app for Windows 8 or later.
 Microsoft Publisher: a desktop publishing app for Windows mostly used for designing brochures, labels, calendars, greeting cards, business cards, newsletters, web site, and postcards.
 Skype for Business: an integrated communications client for conferences and meetings in real time, it is the only Microsoft Office desktop app that is neither useful without a proper network infrastructure nor has the "Microsoft" prefix in its name.
 Microsoft Project: a project management app for Windows to keep track of events and to create network charts and Gantt charts, not bundled in any Office suite.
 Microsoft Teams: a platform that combines workplace chat, meetings, notes, and attachments. Microsoft announced that Teams would eventually replace Skype for Business.
 Microsoft Visio: a diagram and flowcharting app for Windows not bundled in any Office suite.

         Windows versions
Microsoft Office 4.0, inside Windows 3.1
 Microsoft Office for Windows
Microsoft Office for Windows started in October 1990 as a bundle of three applications designed for Microsoft Windows 3.0: Microsoft Word for Windows 1.1, Microsoft Excel for Windows 2.0 and Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 2.0.
Microsoft Office for Windows 1.5 updated the suite with Microsoft Excel 3.0.
Version 1.6 added Microsoft Mail for PC Networks 2.1 to the bundle.
 Microsoft Office 3.0
Microsoft Office 3.0, also called Microsoft Office 92, was released on August 30, 1992 and contained Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, PowerPoint 3.0 and Mail 3.0. It was the first version of Office also released on CD-ROM. In 1993, The Microsoft Office Professional was released, which added Microsoft Access 1.1.
 Microsoft Office 4.x
Microsoft Office 4.0 was released containing Word 6.0, Excel 4.0a, PowerPoint 3.0 and Mail in 1993. Words version number jumped from 2.0 to 6.0 so that it would have the same version number as the MS-DOS and Macintosh versions (Excel and PowerPoint were already numbered the same as the Macintosh versions).
Microsoft Office 4.2 for Windows NT was released in 1994 for i386, Alpha, MIPS and PowerPC architectures, containing Word 6.0 and Excel 5.0 (both 32-bit, PowerPoint 4.0 (16-bit), and Microsoft Office Manager 4.2 (the precursor to the Office Shortcut Bar).
 Microsoft Office 95 and 97
Microsoft Office 95 was released on August 24, 1995. Software version numbers were altered again to create parity across the suite—every program was called version 7.0 meaning all but Word missed out versions. It was designed as a fully 32-bit version to match Windows 95. Office 95 was available in two versions, Office 95 Standard and Office 95 Professional. The standard version consisted of Word 7.0, Excel 7.0, PowerPoint 7.0, and Schedule+ 7.0. The professional edition contained all of the items in the standard version plus Microsoft Access 7.0. If the professional version was purchased in CD-ROM form, it also included Bookshelf.
The logo used in Office 95 returns in Office 97, 2000 and XP. Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition also uses a similar logo.
Microsoft Office 97 (Office 8.0) included hundreds of new features and improvements, such as introducing command bars, a paradigm in which menus and toolbars were made more similar in capability and visual design. Office 97 also featured Natural Language Systems and grammar checking. Office 97 was the first version of Office to include the Office Assistant. In Brazil, it was also the first version to introduce the Registration Wizard, a precursor to Microsoft Product Activation.
 Microsoft Office 2000 to 2003
Microsoft Office 2000 (Office 9.0) introduced adaptive menus, where little-used options were hidden from the user. It also introduced a new security feature, built around digital signatures, to diminish the threat of macro viruses. Office 2000 automatically trusts macros (written in VBA 6) that were digitally signed from authors who have been previously designated as trusted. The Registration Wizard, a precursor to Microsoft Product Activation, remained in Brazil and was
also extended to Australia and New Zealand, though not for volume-licensed editions. Academic software in the United States and Canada also featured the Registration Wizard.
Microsoft Office XP (Office 10.0 or Office 2002) was released in conjunction with Windows XP, and was a major upgrade with numerous enhancements and changes over Office 2000. Office XP introduced the Safe Mode feature, which allows applications such as Outlook to boot when it might otherwise fail by bypassing a corrupted registry or a faulty add-in. Smart tag is a technology introduced with Office XP in Word and Excel and discontinued in Office 2010. Office XP includes integrated voice command and text dictation capabilities, as well as handwriting recognition. It was the first version to require Microsoft Product Activation worldwide and in all editions as an anti-piracy measure, which attracted widespread controversy. Product Activation remained absent from Office for Mac releases until it was introduced in Office 2011 for Mac.
Microsoft Office 2003 (Office 11.0) was released in 2003. It featured a new logo. Two new applications made their debut in Office 2003: Microsoft InfoPath and OneNote. It is the first version to use new, more colorful icons. Outlook 2003 provides improved functionality in many areas, including Kerberos authentication, RPC over HTTP, Cached Exchange Mode, and an improved junk mail filter.
 Microsoft Office 2007
Microsoft Office 2007 (Office 12.0) was released in 2007. Office 2007s new features include a new graphical user interface called the Fluent User Interface, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception with a tabbed toolbar, known as the Ribbon; new XML-based file formats called Office Open XML; and the inclusion of Groove, a collaborative software application.
 Microsoft Office 2010
Microsoft Office 2010 (Office 14.0, because Microsoft skipped 13.0) was finalized on April 15, 2010 and made available to consumers on June 15, 2010. The main features of Office 2010 include the backstage file menu, new collaboration tools, a customizable ribbon, protected view and a navigation panel. This is the first version to ship in 32-bit and 64-bit variants. Microsoft Office 2010 featured a new logo, which resembled the 2007 logo, except in gold, and with a modification in shape.
Microsoft released Service Pack 1 for Office 2010 on June 28, 2011 and Service Pack 2 on July 16, 2013.
 Microsoft Office 2013
A technical preview of Microsoft Office 2013 (Build 15.0.3612.1010) was released on January 30, 2012, and a Customer Preview version was made available to consumers on July 16, 2012. It sports a revamped application interface; the interface is based on Metro, the interface of
Windows Phone and Windows 8. Microsoft Outlook has received the most pronounced changes so far; for example, the Metro interface provides a new visualization for scheduled tasks. PowerPoint includes more templates and transition effects, and OneNote includes a new splash screen. On May 16, 2011, new images of Office 15 were revealed, showing Excel with a tool for filtering data in a timeline, the ability to convert Roman numerals to Arabic numerals, and the integration of advanced trigonometric functions. In Word, the capability of inserting video and audio online as well as the broadcasting of documents on the Web were implemented. Microsoft has promised support for Office Open XML Strict starting with version 15, a format Microsoft has submitted to the ISO for interoperability with other office suites, and to aid adoption in the public sector. This version can read and write ODF 1.2 (Windows only).
On October 24, 2012, Office 2013 Professional Plus was released to manufacturing and was made available to TechNet and MSDN subscribers for download. On November 15, 2012, the 60-day trial version was released for public download. Office 2013 was released to general availability on January 29, 2013.

Mac versions
Prior to packaging its various office-type Mac OS software applications into Office, Microsoft released Mac versions of Word 1.0 in 1984, the first year of the Macintosh computer; Excel 1.0 in 1985; and PowerPoint 1.0 in 1987. Microsoft does not include its Access database application in Office for Mac.
Microsoft has noted that some features are added to Office for Mac before they appear in Windows versions, such as Office for Mac 2001s Office Project Gallery and PowerPoint Movie feature, which allows users to save presentations as QuickTime movies. However, Microsoft Office for Mac has been long criticized for its lack of support of Unicode and for its lack of support for right-to-left languages, notably Arabic, Hebrew and Persian.
Early Office for Mac releases (1989–1994)
Microsoft Office for Mac was introduced for Mac OS in 1989, before Office was released for Windows. It included Word 4.0, Excel 2.2, PowerPoint 2.01, and Mail 1.37. It was originally a limited-time promotion but later became a regular product. With the release of Office on CD-ROM later that year, Microsoft became the first major Mac publisher to put its applications on CD-ROM.
Microsoft Office 1.5 for Mac was released in 1991 and included the updated Excel 3.0, the first application to support Apples System 7 operating system. Microsoft Office 3.0 for Mac was released in 1992 and included Word 5.0, Excel 4.0, PowerPoint 3.0 and Mail Client. Excel 4.0 was the first application to support new AppleScript.
Microsoft Office 4.2 for Mac was released in 1994. (Version 4.0 was skipped to synchronize version numbers with Office for Windows) Version 4.2 included Word 6.0, Excel 5.0, PowerPoint 4.0 and Mail 3.2. It was the first Office suite for Power Macintosh. Its user interface was identical to Office 4.2 for Windows leading many customers to comment that it wasnt Mac-like enough. The final release for Mac 68K was Office 4.2.1, which updated Word to version 6.0.1, somewhat improving performance.
Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition was unveiled at MacWorld Expo/San Francisco in 1998. It introduced the Internet Explorer 4.0 web browser and Outlook Express, an Internet e-mail client and Usenet newsgroup reader. Office 98 was re-engineered by Microsofts Macintosh Business Unit to satisfy customers desire for software they felt was more Mac-like. It included drag–and-drop installation, self-repairing applications and Quick Thesaurus, before such features were available in Office for Windows. It also was the first version to support QuickTime movies.
Microsoft Office 2001 and v. X
Microsoft Office v. X box art
Microsoft Office 2001 was launched in 2000 as the last Office suite for the classic Mac OS. It required a PowerPC processor. This version introduced Entourage, an e-mail client that included information management tools such as a calendar, an address book, task lists and notes.
Microsoft Office v. X was released in 2001 and was the first version of Microsoft Office for Mac OS X. Support for Office v. X ended on January 9, 2007 after the release of the final update, 10.1.9 Office v.X includes Word X, Excel X, PowerPoint X, Entourage X, MSN Messenger for Mac and Windows Media Player 9 for Mac; it was the last version of Office for Mac to include Internet Explorer for Mac.
Office 2004
Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac was released on May 11, 2004. It includes Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Entourage and Virtual PC. It is the final version of Office to be built exclusively for PowerPC and to officially support G3 processors, as its sequel lists a G4, G5 or Intel processor as a requirement. It was notable for supporting Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which is unavailable in Office 2008. This led Microsoft to extend support for Office 2004 from October 13, 2009 to January 10, 2012. VBA functionality was reintroduced in Office 2011, which is only compatible with Intel processors.
Office 2008
Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac was released on January 15, 2008. It was the only Office for Mac suite to be compiled as a universal binary, being the first to feature native Intel support and the last to feature PowerPC support for G4 and G5 processors, although the suite is unofficially compatible with G3 processors. New features include native Office Open XML file format support, which debuted in Office 2007 for Windows, and stronger Microsoft Office password protection employing AES-128 and SHA-1. Benchmarks suggested that compared to its predecessor, Office 2008 ran at similar speeds on Intel machines and slower speeds on PowerPC machines. Office 2008 also lacked Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) support, leaving it with only 15 months of additional mainstream support compared to its predecessor. Nevertheless, five months after it was released, Microsoft said that Office 2008 was "selling faster than any previous version of Office for Mac in the past 19 years" and affirmed "its commitment to future products for the Mac."
Office 2011
Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 was released on October 26, 2010; it is the first version of Office for Mac to be compiled exclusively for Intel processors, dropping support for the PowerPC architecture. It features an OS X version of Outlook to replace the Entourage email client. This version of Outlook is intended to make the OS X version of Office work better with Microsofts Exchange server and with those using Office for Windows. Office 2011 includes a Mac-based Ribbon similar to Office for Windows.
OneNote and Outlook release (2014)
Microsoft OneNote for Mac was released on March 17, 2014. It marks the companys first release of the note-taking software on the Mac. It is available as a free download to all users of the Mac App Store in OS X Mavericks.
Microsoft Outlook 2016 for Mac debuted on October 31, 2014. It requires a paid Office 365 subscription, meaning that traditional Office 2011 retail or volume licenses cannot activate this version of Outlook. On that day, Microsoft confirmed that it would release the next version of Office for Mac in late 2015.
Despite dropping support for older versions of OS X and only keeping support for 64-bit-only versions of OS X, these versions of OneNote and Outlook are 32-bit applications like their predecessors.
Office 2016
Main article: Microsoft Office 2016
The first Preview version of Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac was released on March 5, 2015. On July 9, 2015, Microsoft released the final version of Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote. It was immediately made available for Office 365 subscribers with either a Home, Personal, Business, Business Premium, E3 or ProPlus subscription.

         A Beginner’s Guide to Microsoft Office
 A Beginner‟s Guide to Microsoft Office
Microsoft Word is a word processing program that was first made public by Microsoft in the early 1980s. It allows users to type and manipulate text in a graphic environment that resembles a page of paper. Extra features, such as tables, images and advanced formatting give users more options to customize their documents. Over the past three decades, there have been a number of updates and additions to Microsoft Word. Today it is one of the most widely used word processors available for Macs and PCs. It is often taught to students in schools and required as part of the basic computer requirements for many office jobs. In this guide, new users will learn the basic functions of Microsoft Word and how to use them.
Alignment – The alignment options dictate whether the left and right edges of the text in a document adhere to the right side, left, center or justified. Alignment can be set from the formatting toolbar at the top of the window or under by choosing ―Paragraph‖ under the Format menu.
Bullets/Numbering – When creating a list of text items, users can choose from several bullet or numbering system to add a small graphic icon or series of numbers before each item. To add bullets or numbering to a series of text, click on the corresponding buttons in the formatting toolbar or choose ―Bullets and Numbering‖ from the Format menu.
Clipboard – The clipboard acts as a type of storage area when a piece of text is temporarily removed and stored for later use within the same session. Using the Cut or Copy commands will place the text in the clipboard. Click on ―Clipboard‖ under the Edit menu to view any text that may be temporarily stored in it.
Copy – Copying text simply means making a replica of any text that is currently selecting and saving it to the clipboard. Pressing the Control and C keys in Windows or Command and C on a Mac will copy the text. Alternatively, users can also select the text and then click the ―Copy‖ option under the Edit menu or in the main toolbar.
Cut – Cutting text removes the text entirely from the viewable document and stores it in the clipboard. Control-X or Command-X are the keyboard shortcuts for the Cut function on Windows and Mac respectively. The Cut function can also be found under the Edit menu or the toolbar.
Document – Each document in Microsoft Word is essentially a new file. Each document can be several pages long. A new document can be created by hitting Control-N or Command-N, or by choosing the ―New Blank Document‖ option from the File menu or the standard toolbar.
Edit – The edit menu or toolbar in Microsoft Word allows users to perform basic editing functions in their document such as copying, cutting and pasting. It also contains options for the Undo and Find/Replace functions.
Font – A font is a type of design for text and typically incorporates this design into each letter, number and symbol found on a keyboard. Fonts can range from formal to whimsical. Microsoft Word comes with a series of provided fonts and additional ones can also be downloaded if needed. To change the font used in a document, select the text and either clicks on the main Font menu, the Font drop-down menu in the formatting toolbar or hit Control-D or Command D.
Footer – The footer is the text that consistently appears on every page of a document, at the bottom of each page. Footers normally include details such as the page number, or a company‘s name and contact details in formal documents. Add or edit a footer by choosing ―Header and Footer‖ under the View menu.
Format – The Format menu (or toolbar) goes one step further than the Edit menu. Users can make stylistic changes by changing the look of the text itself, paragraphs, lists and more.
Header – The header is similar to footer except that it sits at the very top of every page in a document. Headers often contain page numbers, the document name or sub-titles within a document. The header can be edited by clicking on ―Header and Footer‖ within the View menu.
Justify, left justified, right justified – Justification is a type of alignment for text in a word processor. Justify ensures that both the left and right sides of the text in every paragraph run in a straight line. Left justify makes only the left side of the text aligned, while the right side remains ragged. Right justified does the complete opposite, with only the right side of the text aligned. Users can apply justification to their text by clicking on the corresponding buttons in the formatting toolbar or by selecting the text and clicking on ―Paragraph‖ under the Format menu.
Open – The Open command opens an existing document in Microsoft Word. Command or Control plus O, or choosing ―Open…‖ from the File menu will provide a pop-up window for users to select the document they wish to open.
Paste – The paste command takes any previously copied or cut text and lays it down within the document where the cursor is pointing. Control or Command plus V, or ―Paste‖ from the Edit menu or standard toolbar will run the paste function.
Print – The print command first opens a window where users can specify parameters of the paper, printer and ink they wish to print with and it provides a preview of what the physical print will look like. Control or Command plus P, or clicking on ―Print‖ in the File menu or standard toolbar lets users access the print window.
Quick access tool bar – The quick access toolbar is a small and moveable toolbar at the top of the document window. It usually contains buttons to save, undo, redo and print. This toolbar can also be customized to include or remove other commands.
Ribbon – The Ribbon is a type of toolbar found in versions of Microsoft Office 2007. It contains graphic buttons for commands and similar commands are shown in groups for easy access.
Save – The save command is one of the most important ones. It saves all of the work done to date within a document. The save command enables users to return to the same document later and continue writing, editing or printing. Control or Command plus S, or clicking ―Save‖ under the File menu or standard toolbar will save the document. The ―Save As‖ option is slightly different; it allows users to save the document as a different version by adding a different file name.
Text – Text is any of the words and paragraphs that a user types within a document.
Standard tool bar – The standard tool bar is the row of icons at the top of the document. Each of these buttons is used for basic functions such as saving, opening or printing documents, among other commands.
Undo – The undo feature keeps track of each command that a user issues while working on their document. Issuing the undo command allows the user to go back one step and restore the document as it was before their latest editing command. Related to the Undo command is Redo, which lets the user redo the same formatting command again. Control or Command plus Z, or ―Undo‖ under the Edit menu is used to undo a command, while Control or Command plus Y or ―Redo‖ under Edit is to redo a command.

         How to Use Excel: 14 Simple Excel Tips, Tricks, and Shortcuts by Rachel Leist
Sometimes, Excel seems too good to be true. All I have to do is enter a formula, and pretty much anything Id ever need to do manually can be done automatically. Need to merge two sheets with similar data? Excel can do it. Need to do simple math? Excel can do it. Need to combine information in multiple cells? Excel can do it.
 How to Use Excel
If youre just starting out with Excel, there are a few basic commands that we suggest you become familiar with. These are things like:
 Creating a new spreadsheet from scratch.
 Executing basic computations in a spreadsheet, like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing in a spreadsheet.
 Writing and formatting column text and titles.
 Excels auto-fill features.
 Adding or deleting single columns, rows, and spreadsheets. Below, well get into how to add things like multiple columns and rows.
 Keeping column and row titles visible as you scroll past them in a spreadsheet, so that you know what data youre filling as you move further down the document.
 14 Excel Tips to Try
1) Pivot Tables
Pivot Tables are used to reorganize data in a spreadsheet. They wont change the data that you have, but they can sum up values and compare different information in your spreadsheet, depending on what youd like them to do.
Lets take a look at an example. Lets say I want to take a look at how many people are in each house at Hogwarts. You may be thinking that I dont have too much data, but for longer data sets, this will come in handy.
To create the Pivot Table, I go to Data > Pivot Table. Excel will automatically populate your Pivot Table, but you can always change around the order of the data. Then, you have four options to choose from.
 Report Filter: This allows you to only look at certain rows in your dataset. For example, if I wanted to create a filter by house, I could choose to only include students in Gryffindor instead of all students
 Column Labels: These could be your headers in the dataset.
 Row Labels: These could be your rows in the dataset. Both Row and Column labels can contain data from your columns (e.g. First Name can be dragged to either the Row or Column label -- it just depends on how you want to see the data.)
 Value: This section allows you to look at your data differently. Instead of just pulling in any numeric value, you can sum, count, average, max, min, count numbers, or do a few other manipulations with your data. In fact, by default, when you drag a field to Value, it always does a count.
Since I want to count the number of students in each house, Ill go to the Pivot Table and drag the House column to both the Row Labels and the Values. This will sum up the number of students associated with each house.
2) Add More Than One New Row or Column
As you play around with your data, you might find you constantly need to add more rows and columns. Sometimes, you may even need to add hundreds of rows. Doing this one-by-one would be super tedious. Luckily, theres always an easier way.
To add multiple rows or columns in a spreadsheet, highlight the same number of preexisting rows or columns that you want to add. Then, right-click and select "Insert."
In the example below, I want to add an additional three rows. By highlighting three rows and then clicking insert, Im able to add an additional three blank rows into my spreadsheet quickly and easily.
3) Filters
When youre looking at very large data sets, you dont usually need to be looking at every single row at the same time. Sometimes, you only want to look at data that fit into certain criteria. Thats where filters come in.
Filters allow you to pare down your data to only look at certain rows at one time. In Excel, a filter can be added to each column in your data -- and from there, you can then choose which cells you want to view at once.
Lets take a look at the example below. Add a filter by clicking the Data tab and selecting "Filter." Clicking the arrow next to the column headers and youll be able to choose whether you want your data to be organized in ascending or descending order, as well as which specific rows you want to show.
In my Harry Potter example, lets say I only want to see the students in Gryffindor. By selecting the Gryffindor filter, the other rows disappear.
Pro Tip: Copy and paste the values in the spreadsheet when a Filter is on to do additional analysis in another spreadsheet.
4) Remove Duplicates
Larger data sets tend to have duplicate content. You may have a list of multiple contacts in a company and only want to see the number of companies you have. In situations like this, removing the duplicates comes in quite handy.
To remove your duplicates, highlight the row or column that you want to remove duplicates of. Then, go to the Data tab, and select "Remove Duplicates" (under Tools). A pop-up will appear to confirm which data you want to work with. Select "Remove Duplicates," and youre good to go.
You can also use this feature to remove an entire row based on a duplicate column value. So if you have three rows with Harry Potters information and you only need to see one, then you can select the whole dataset and then remove duplicates based on email. Your resulting list will have only unique names without any duplicates.
5) Transpose
When you have low rows of data in your spreadsheet, you might decide you actually want to transform the items in one of those rows into columns (or vice versa). It would take a lot of time to copy and paste each individual header -- but what the transpose feature allows you to do is simply move your row data into columns, or the other way around.
Start by highlighting the column that you want to transpose into rows. Right-click it, and then select "Copy." Next, select the cells on your spreadsheet where you want your first row or column to begin. Right-click on the cell, and then select "Paste Special."
A module will appear -- at the bottom, youll see an option to transpose. Check that box and select OK. Your column will now be transferred to a row or vice-versa.
6) Text to Columns
What if you want to split out information thats in one cell into two different cells? For example, maybe you want to pull out someones company name through their email address. Or perhaps you want to separate someones full name into a first and last name for your email marketing templates.
Thanks to Excel, both are possible. First, highlight the column that you want to split up. Next, go to the Data tab and select "Text to Columns." A module will appear with additional information.
First, you need to select either "Delimited" or "Fixed Width."
 "Delimited" means you want to break up the column based on characters such as commas, spaces, or tabs.
 "Fixed Width" means you want to select the exact location on all the columns that you want the split to occur.
In the example case below, lets select "Delimited" so we can separate the full name into first name and last name.
Then, its time to choose the Delimiters. This could be a tab, semi-colon, comma, space, or something else. ("Something else" could be the "@" sign used in an email address, for example.) In our example, lets choose the space. Excel will then show you a preview of what your new columns will look like.
When youre happy with the preview, press "Next." This page will allow you to select Advanced Formats if you choose to. When youre done, click "Finish."
Excel Formulas
7) Simple Calculations
In addition to doing pretty complex calculations, Excel can help you do simple arithmetic like adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing any of your data.
 To add, use the + sign.
 To subtract, use the - sign.
 To multiply, use the * sign.
 To divide, use the / sign.
You can also use parenthesis to ensure certain calculations are done first. In the example below (10+10*10), the second and third 10 were multiplied together before adding the additional 10. However, if we made it (10+10)*10, the first and second 10 would be added together first.
Bonus: If you want the average of a set of numbers, you can use the formula =AVERAGE(Cell Range). If you want to sum up a column of numbers, you can use the formula =SUM(Cell Range).
8) Conditional Formatting Formula
Conditional formatting allows you to change a cells color based on the information within the cell. For example, if you want to flag certain numbers that are above average or in the top 10% of the data in your spreadsheet, you can do that. If you want to color code commonalities between different rows in Excel, you can do that. This will help you quickly see information the is important to you.
To get started, highlight the group of cells you want to use conditional formatting on. Then, choose "Conditional Formatting" from the Home menu and select your logic from the dropdown. (You can also create your own rule if you want something different.)
A window will pop up that prompts you to provide more information about your formatting rule. Select "OK" when youre done, and you should see your results automatically appear.
9) IF Statement
Sometimes, we dont want to count the number of times a value appears. Instead, we want to input different information into a cell if there is a corresponding cell with that information.
For example, in the situation below, I want to award ten points to everyone who belongs in the Gryffindor house. Instead of manually typing in 10s next to each Gryffindor students name, I can use the IF THEN Excel formula to say that if the student is in Gryffindor, then they should get ten points.
The formula: IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value of false)
Example Shown Below: =IF(D2="Gryffindor","10","0")
In general terms, the formula would be IF(Logical Test, value of true, value of false). Lets dig into each of these variables.
 Logical_Test: The logical test is the "IF" part of the statement. In this case, the logic is D2="Gryffindor" because we want to make sure that the cell corresponding with the student says "Gryffindor." Make sure to put Gryffindor in quotation marks here.
 Value_if_True: This is what we want the cell to show if the value is true. In this case, we want the cell to show "10" to indicate that the student was awarded the 10 points. Only use quotation marks if you want the result to be text instead of a number.
 Value_if_False: This is what we want the cell to show if the value is false. In this case, for any student not in Gryffindor, we want the cell to show "0" to show 0 points. Only use quotation marks if you want the result to be text instead of a number.
Note: In the example above, I awarded 10 points to everyone in Gryffindor. If I later wanted to sum the total number of points, I wouldnt be able to because the 10s are in quotes, thus making them text and not a number that Excel can sum.
10) Dollar Signs
Have you ever seen a dollar sign in an Excel formula? When used in a formula, it isnt representing an American dollar; instead, it makes sure that the exact column and row are held the same even if you copy the same formula in adjacent rows.
You see, a cell reference -- when you refer to cell A5 from cell C5, for example -- is relative by default. In that case, youre actually referring to a cell thats five columns to the left (C minus A) and in the same row (5). This is called a relative formula. When you copy a relative formula from one cell to another, itll adjust the values in the formula based on where its moved. But sometimes, we want those values to stay the same no matter whether theyre moved around or not -- and we can do that by making the formula in the cell into whats called an absolute formula.
To change the relative formula (=A5+C5) into an absolute formula, wed precede the row and column values by dollar signs, like this: (=$A$5+$C$5). (Learn more on Microsoft Offices support page here.)
Excel Functions
11) VLOOKUP Function
Have you ever had two sets of data on two different spreadsheets that you want to combine into a single spreadsheet?
For example, you might have a list of peoples names next to their email addresses in one spreadsheet, and a list of those same peoples email addresses next to their company names in the other -- but you want the names, email addresses, and company names of those people to appear in one place.
I have to combine data sets like this a lot -- and when I do, the VLOOKUP is my go-to formula. Before you use the formula, though, be absolutely sure that you have at least one column that appears identically in both places.
Scour your data sets to make sure the column of data youre using to combine your information is exactly the same, including no extra spaces.
The formula: =VLOOKUP (lookup value, table array, column number, [range lookup])
The formula with variables from our example below: =VLOOKUP (C2,Sheet2!A:B,2,FALSE)
In this formula, there are several variables. The following is true when you want to combine information in Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 onto Sheet 1.
 Lookup Value: This is the identical value you have in both spreadsheets. Choose the first value in your first spreadsheet. In the example that follows, this means the first email address on the list, or cell 2 (C2).
 Table Array: The range of columns on Sheet 2 youre going to pull your data from, including the column of data identical to your lookup value (in our example, email addresses) in Sheet 1 as well as the column of data youre trying to copy to Sheet 1. In our example, this is "Sheet2!A:B." "A" means Column A in Sheet 2, which is the column in Sheet 2 where the data identical to our lookup value (email) in Sheet 1 is listed. The "B" means Column B, which contains the information thats only available in Sheet 2 that you want to translate to Sheet 1.
 Column Number: If the table array (the range of columns you just indicated) this tells Excel which column the new data you want to copy to Sheet 1 is located in. In our example, this would be the column that "House" is located in. "House" is the second column in our range of columns (table array), so our column number is 2. [Note: Your range can be more than two columns. For example, if there are three columns on Sheet 2 -- Email, Age, and House -- and you still want to bring House onto Sheet 1, you can still use a VLOOKUP. You just need to change the "2" to a "3" so it pulls back the value in the third column: =VLOOKUP (C2:Sheet2!A:C,3,false).]
 Range Lookup: Use FALSE to ensure you pull in only exact value matches.
In the example below, Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 contain lists describing different information about the same people, and the common thread between the two is their email addresses. Lets say we want to combine both datasets so that all the house information from Sheet 2 translates over to Sheet 1.
So when we type in the formula =VLOOKUP (C2,Sheet2!A: B,2,FALSE), we bring all the house data into Sheet 1.
Keep in mind that VLOOKUP will only pull back values from the second sheet that are to the right of the column containing your identical data. This can lead to some limitations, which is why some people prefer to use the INDEX and MATCH functions instead.
12) INDEX MATCH
Like VLOOKUP, the INDEX and MATCH functions pull in data from another dataset into one central location. Here are the main differences:
1. VLOOKUP is a much simpler formula. If youre working with large data sets that would require thousands of lookups, using the INDEX MATCH function will significantly decrease load time in Excel.
2. INDEX MATCH formulas work right-to-left, whereas VLOOKUP formulas only work as a left-to-right lookup. In other words, if you need to do a lookup that has a lookup column to the right of the results column, then youd have to rearrange those columns in order to do a VLOOKUP. This can be tedious with large datasets and/or lead to errors.
So if I want to combine information in Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 onto Sheet 1, but the column values in Sheets 1 and 2 arent the same, then to do a VLOOKUP, I would need to switch around my columns. In this case, Id choose to do an INDEX MATCH instead.
Lets look at an example. Lets say Sheet 1 contains a list of peoples names and their Hogwarts email addresses, and Sheet 2 contains a list of peoples email addresses and the Patronus that each student has. (For the non-Harry Potter fans out there, every witch or wizard has an animal guardian called a "Patronus" associated with him or her.) The information that lives in both sheets is the column containing email addresses, but this email address column is in different
column numbers on each sheet. Id use the INDEX MATCH formula instead of VLOOKUP so I wouldnt have to switch any columns around.
So whats the formula, then? The INDEX MATCH formula is actually the MATCH formula nested inside the INDEX formula. Youll see I differentiated the MATCH formula using a different color here.
The formula: =INDEX(table array, MATCH formula)
This becomes: =INDEX(table array, MATCH (lookup_value, lookup_array))
The formula with variables from our example below: =INDEX(Sheet2!A:A,(MATCH(Sheet1!C:C,Sheet2!C:C,0)))
Here are the variables:
 Table Array: The range of columns on Sheet 2 containing the new data you want to bring over to Sheet 1. In our example, "A" means Column A, which contains the "Patronus" information for each person.
 Lookup Value: This is the column in Sheet 1 that contains identical values in both spreadsheets. In the example that follows, this means the "email" column on Sheet 1, which is Column C. So: Sheet1!C:C.
 Lookup Array: This is the column in Sheet 2 that contains identical values in both spreadsheets. In the example that follows, this refers to the "email" column on Sheet 2, which happens to also be Column C. So: Sheet2!C:C.
Once you have your variables straight, type in the INDEX MATCH formula in the top-most cell of the blank Patronus column on Sheet 1, where you want the combined information to live.
13) COUNTIF Function
Instead of manually counting how often a certain value or number appears, let Excel do the work for you. With the COUNTIF function, Excel can count the number of times a word or number appears in any range of cells.
For example, lets say I want to count the number of times the word "Gryffindor" appears in my data set.
The formula: =COUNTIF (range, criteria)
The formula with variables from our example below: =COUNTIF (D:D,"Gryffindor")
In this formula, there are several variables:
 Range: The range that we want the formula to cover. In this case, since were only focusing on one column, we use "D:D" to indicate that the first and last column are both D. If I were looking at columns C and D, I would use "C:D."
 Criteria: Whatever number or piece of text you want Excel to count. Only use quotation marks if you want the result to be text instead of a number. In our example, the criteria are "Gryffindor."
Simply typing in the COUNTIF formula in any cell and pressing "Enter" will show me how many times the word "Gryffindor" appears in the dataset.
14) Combine cells using ""
Databases tend to split out data to make it as exact as possible. For example, instead of having a data that shows a persons full name, a database might have the data as a first name and then a last name in separate columns. Or, it may have a persons location separated by city, state, and zip code. In Excel, you can combine cells with different data into one cell by using the "" sign in your function.
The formula with variables from our example below: =A2" "B2
Lets go through the formula together using an example. Pretend we want to combine first names and last names into full names in a single column. To do this, wed first put our cursor in the blank cell where we want the full name to appear. Next, wed highlight one cell that contains a first name, type in an "" sign, and then highlight a cell with the corresponding last name.
But youre not finished -- if all you type in is =A2B2, then there will not be a space between the persons first name and last name. To add that necessary space, use the function =A2" "B2. The quotation marks around the space tell Excel to put a space in between the first and last name.
To make this true for multiple rows, simply drag the corner of that first cell downward as shown in the example.

Tips for creating an effective presentation Consider the following tips to keep your audience interested.
Minimize the number of slides To maintain a clear message and to keep your audience attentive and interested, keep the number of slides in your presentation to a minimum.
Choose an audience-friendly font size The audience must be able to read your slides from a distance. Generally speaking, a font size smaller than 30 might be too difficult for the audience to see.
Keep your slide text simple You want your audience to listen to you present your information, instead of reading the screen. Use bullets or short sentences, and try to keep each item to one line. Some projectors crop slides at the edges, so that long sentences might be cropped.
Use visuals to help express your message Pictures, charts, graphs, and Smart Art graphics provide visual cues for your audience to remember. Add meaningful art to complement the text and messaging on your slides. As with text, however, avoid including too many visual aids on your slide.
Make labels for charts and graphs understandable Use only enough text to make label elements in a chart or graph comprehensible.
Apply subtle, consistent slide backgrounds
Choose an appealing, consistent template or theme that is not too eye-catching. You dont want the background or design to detract from your message.
However, you also want to provide a contrast between the background color and text color. The built-in themes in PowerPoint set the contrast between a light background with dark colored text or dark background with light colored text.
For more information about how to use themes, see Apply a theme to add color and style to your presentation.
Check the spelling and grammar
To earn and maintain the respect of your audience, always check the spelling and grammar in your presentation.
 Using PowerPoint
 Introduction
This study guide focuses on how you can utilise PowerPoint to effectively support your presentations. It does not cover the technical aspects of using the software; for this see our guide on using PowerPoint 2010. If you have experience of using other Microsoft Office programs such as Word, you may find PowerPoint easy to use. For information on the technical aspects of using the software, see our Microsoft PowerPoint resources.
 What is PowerPoint?
PowerPoint is a computer program that allows you to create and show slides to support a presentation. You can combine text, graphics and multi-media content to create professional presentations. As a presentation tool PowerPoint can be used to:
 organize and structure your presentation;
 create a professional and consistent format;
 provide an illustrative backdrop for the content of your presentation;
 Animate your slides to give them greater visual impact.
PowerPoint has become enormously popular and you are likely to have seen it used by your lecturers and fellow students or in a presentation outside of the University. Learning to present with PowerPoint will increase your employability as it is the world‘s most popular presentational software. Used well, PowerPoint can improve the clarity of your presentations and help you to
illustrate your message and engage your audience. The strategies contained in this study guide will help you to use PowerPoint effectively in any type of presentation.
Before you begin
Not all presentations require support from PowerPoint so you should consider whether it is appropriate for your presentation. This decision will need to take into account the venue of your presentation, the availability of equipment, the time available and the expectations of the audience. Whether you choose to use PowerPoint or not, your presentation will need to be carefully planned and structured in order to achieve your objectives. See Student Learning Development‘s planning an effective presentation study guide for advice on planning the content and structure of your presentation.
Step 1: Designing PowerPoint slides
There are a number of features to consider when designing effective PowerPoint slides. The guidelines given below will ensure you create slides that will be easy for your audience to read and understand.
Using color
 Be consistent. Ensure that all of your slides have the same or similar background images and colour schemes. PowerPoint’s design templates can be used for this.
 Prepare slides that use a bold colour contrast, e.g. black or deep blue text on a cream background (black and white can be too glaring for the audience).
 Avoid using red or green for text or highlighting as it can be difficult to read.
Using text
 Avoid using too much text. A useful guideline is the six-by-six rule (slides should have no more than six bullet points and each bullet point should be no more than six words long).
 Create bullet points which are clear summaries of key points. It is not necessary for bullet points to be complete sentences.
 Don’t mix up your fonts and font sizes. Too many variations in font size and type can be visually confusing.
 Ensure that your text is at least 24pt otherwise it may be difficult to read on screen.
 Choose left align for all text to make it easier to read.
 Avoid multiple columns of text on a single slide as they can be difficult to follow on screen.
 Use bold for a clear and simple form of emphasis and headings rather than UPPER CASE, italics or underlining.
 Set clear hierarchies for type size to help your audience distinguish between headings, main text and other types of text.
Step 2: Making the most of graphics and animations
 Using graphics
Many people find it easier to understand and remember concepts if images are used in addition to text. PowerPoint allows you to easily include graphics in your presentations, but think about the issues listed below.
 Try not to use Clip Art (files of images that come free with software packages) that you have seen in lots of other people’s presentations: familiar images have less impact on an audience.
 Choose an appropriate quality for scanned images. Scan at 150 dpi for images where accurate colour reproduction is not important and at 300 dpi for higher quality images.
 Beware of images that you take from the internet. They are generally of a very low quality and are likely to pixelate (lose their smoothness) when you project them onto a large screen.
 Make sure graphics are relevant to your text and not just decorative.
 Consider using graphics to replace text where you think an image would be easier to understand.
 Ensure that the images that you use are simple and clear enough to be easily read at a distance. A small, overly complex and poor quality image will only frustrate your audience.
 Using animations and transitions Animating elements of slides and using Slide Transition are two of the most powerful features that PowerPoint offers. However, it is very easy to overdo your use of these features and create a presentation where the animation distracts your audience from the content of your presentation.
 Use animations to show progression. Animation is very effective at revealing a process one stage at a time.
 Be conservative. Make sure that any animation you use serves a clear purpose (e.g. to introduce a new piece of information at an appropriate point). If you cannot think of a reason to animate your slide - don’t do it!
 Be consistent. Try to ensure that you use similar types of animation for similar functions. For example, if your text always drives in from the left it will be distracting if it suddenly appears from another direction or uses another animation technique.
Step 3: Using PowerPoint to help structure your presentation
Once you have designed your slides you should review your planning and think about whether you need to refine the structure of your presentation. PowerPoint offers a number of features that can help you. All views can be selected from the „View‟ menu.
 Use the ‘Outline’ tab in Normal View to display the textual content of your presentation. This can help you to focus on and review the structure of your content rather than the visual impact of your presentation.
 Use the ‘Notes’ pane in Normal View to create a script or prompts which you can use when you are delivering the presentation.
 Use the Slide Sorter View to gain an overview of the visual impact of your presentation. This is also a useful view for rearranging the order of your slides or deleting multiple slides.
Use these PowerPoint tools to give you an overview of your presentation so that you can create a clear focus and a logical structure for your talk. Avoid using too many slides in your presentation, as this will be distracting for your audience. In general you should use about one slide every two minutes, so a ten-minute presentation should have around five slides.
Step 4: Preparing to Present
Find out as much as you can about your audience and the environment in which you are going to be presenting before you present. Ask yourself the following questions:
 How large is the room that I am going to be presenting in? Will people be able to see my slides from the back?
 Do any of my audience have any special requirements (visually or hearing impaired, dyslexic, etc.)? Is there anything that I can do to ensure that they can access the presentation?
 Have I rehearsed my presentation to check that all of my slides work in the way they are supposed to?
 Does my presentation fit into the time that I have been allotted? Choosing Rehearse Timings from the Slide Show menu can help you to judge how much time you are spending on each aspect of your presentation (but choose ‘No’ when asked ‘Do you want to keep the new slide timings to use when you view the slide show?’).
 Have I checked that the necessary equipment (laptop, data projector, speakers for sound) has been booked for my presentation?
 Do I have an alternative plan in case the technology fails? This may be a second copy of the slides on acetates, a set of handouts or a second disk format (such as USB drive).
Step 5: Presenting with PowerPoint
An effective presenter uses PowerPoint to illustrate and emphasize points that are made in the presentation. An audience that is trying to copy down detailed information from slides will not be able to give you their full attention. Consider using handouts for your audience so they are
free to concentrate on listening and understanding. Some points to consider when presenting with slides are given below.
 Treat each slide as a mini-presentation where you make a point to introduce the idea, give the detail and then conclude that slide with an explanation of how the point fits in with the rest of your presentation.
 Direct your audience’s attention to the slides when they contain information that is key to getting your message across.
 Give your audience time to assimilate material on your slides. If, for example, a slide contains a quotation or a diagram – introduce the slide, give them time to read and understand it and then explain its relevance.
 Don’t leave your screen saver on, as this will distract your audience.
 Don’t move your pointer on the screen unless you are using it to demonstrate something as this will distract your audience.
 Don’t just read out the text on the slides, they should be a summary or a supplement to the content of your spoken presentation.

        Basic tasks for an Access desktop database
Access desktop databases can help you store and track just about any kind of information, such as inventory, contacts, or business processes.
Let‘s take a walk through the paths you can take to create an Access desktop database, add data to it, and then learn about next steps towards customizing and using your new database.
In this article
 Choose a template
 Create a database from scratch
 Add a table
 Copy and paste data
 Import or link to data
 Organize data with the Table Analyzer
 Next steps
 Choose a template
Access templates have built-in tables, queries, forms, and reports that are ready to use. A choice of templates is the first thing you‘ll notice when you start Access, and you can search online for
1. In Access click File > New.
2. Select a desktop database template and enter a name for your database under File Name. (If you don‟t see a template that would work for you, use the Search online templatesbox.)
3. You can either use the default location that Access shows below the File Name box or click the folder icon to pick one.
4. Click Create.
Depending on the template, you might need to do any of the following to get started:
 If Access displays a Login dialog box with an empty list of users:
a. Click New User.
b. Fill in the User Details form.
c. Click Save  Close.
d. Select the user name you just entered, and then click Login.
 If Access displays a Security Warning message in the message bar, and you trust the source of the template, click Enable Content. If the database requires a login, log in again.
.
Create a database from scratch
If none of the templates fit your needs, you might start with a blank desktop database.
1. From Access, click New > Blank desktop database.
2. Type a name for your database in the File Name box.
3. You can either use the default location that Access shows below the File Name box or click the folder icon to pick one.
4. Click Create.
Add a table
In a database, your information is stored in multiple related tables. To create a table:
1. When you open your database for the first time, you‘ll see a blank table in Datasheet view where you can add data. To add another table, click the Create tab > Table. You can either start entering data in the empty field (cell) or paste data from another source like an Excel workbook.
2. To rename a column (field), double-click the column heading, and then type the new name.
Tip: Meaningful names help you know what each field contains without seeing its contents.
1. Click File > Save.
 To add more fields, type in the Click to Add column.
 To move a column, select it by clicking its column heading, and then drag it to where you want it. You can also select contiguous columns and drag them all to a new location.
Copy and paste data
You can copy and paste data from another program like Excel or Word into an Access table. This works best if the data is separated into columns. If the data is in a word processing program, such as Word, either use tags to separate the columns or convert into a table format before copying.
1. If the data needs editing, such as separating full names into first and last names, do that first in the source program.
2. Open the source and copy (Ctrl + C) the data.
3. Open the Access table where you want to add the data in Datasheet view and paste it (Ctrl + V).
4. Double-click each column heading and type a meaningful name.
5. Click File > Save and give your new table a name.
Note: Access sets the data type of each field based on the information you paste into the first row of each column, so make sure that the information in the following rows match the first row.
Import or link to data
You can either import data from other sources, or you can link to the data from Access without moving the information from where it is stored. Linking can be a good option if you have multiple users updating the data and you want to make sure that you are seeing the latest version or if you want to save storage space. You can choose whether you want to link to or import data for most formats. See Import or link to data in another Access database for more information.
The process differs slightly depending on the data source, but these instructions will get you started:
1. On the External Data tab, click the data format you‘ll be importing from or linking to. If you dont see the right format, click More.
Note: If you still cant find the right format, you might need to export the data first to a file format that Access supports (such as a delimited text file).
1. Follow the instructions in the Get External Data dialog box.
When you link, some formats are available as read-only. Here are the external sources that you can import data or link from:
Import
Link
Microsoft Excel
Yes
Yes (read-only)
Microsoft Access

Organize data with the Table Analyzer
You can use the Table Analyzer Wizard to quickly identify redundant data. The wizard then provides a simple way to organize the data into separate tables. Access preserves the original table as a backup.
1. Open the Access database that contains the table that you want to analyze.
2. Click Database Tools > Analyze Table.
The first two pages of the wizard contain a short tutorial with examples. If you see a check box labeled Show introductory pages?, check the box, and then click Back twice to see the introduction. If you dont want to see the introductory pages again, uncheck Show introductory pages?

 Create an Access form
 Introduction to reports in Access
 Protect your data with backup and restore processes
Introduction to tables
Tables are essential objects in a database because they hold all the information or data. For example, a database for a business can have a Contacts table that stores the names of their suppliers, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. Because other database objects depend so heavily on tables, you should always start your design of a database by creating all of its tables and then creating any other objects. Before you create tables, consider your requirements and determine all the tables that you might need. For an introduction to planning and designing a database, see Database design basics.

Benefits of using relationships
Overview
A relational database like Access usually has several related tables. In a well-designed database, each table stores data about a particular subject, such as employees or products. A table has records (rows) and fields (columns). Fields have different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, and hyperlinks.
1. A record: Contains specific data, like information about a particular employee or a product.
2. A field: Contains data about one aspect of the table subject, such as first name or e-mail address.
3. A field value: Each record has a field value. For example, Contoso, Ltd. or someone@example.com.
Table and field properties
Tables and fields also have properties that you can set to control their characteristics or behavior.
1. Table properties
2. Field properties
In an Access database, table properties are attributes of a table that affect the appearance or behavior of the table as a whole. Table properties are set in the tables property sheet, in Design view. For example, you can set a tables Default View property to specify how the table is displayed by default.
A field property applies to a particular field in a table and defines one of the fields characteristics or an aspect of the fields behavior. You can set some field properties in Datasheet view. You can also set any field property in Design view by using the Field Properties pane.
 Data types
Every field has a data type. A fields data type indicates the kind of data that the field stores, such as large amounts of text or attached files.
A data type is a field property, but it differs from other field properties as follows:
 You set a fields data type in the table design grid, not in the Field Properties pane.
 A fields data type determines what other properties the field has.
 You must set a fields data type when you create the field.
You can create a new field in Access by entering data in a new column in Datasheet view. When you create a field by entering data in Datasheet view, Access automatically assigns a data type for the field, based on the value that you enter. If no other data type is implied by your input, Access sets the data type to Text. If needed, you can change the data type by using the Ribbon.
Examples of automatic data type detection
The following table shows how automatic data type detection works in Datasheet view.
If you enter:
Access creates a field with a data type of:

 Table relationships
Although each table stores data about a different subject, tables in an Access database usually store data about subjects that are related to each other. For example, a database might contain:
 A customers table that lists your company‘s customers and their addresses.
 A products table that lists the products that you sell, including prices and pictures for each item.
 An orders table that tracks customer orders.
Because you store data about different subjects in separate tables, you need some way to tie the data together so that you can easily combine related data from those separate tables. To connect the data stored in different tables, you create relationships. A relationship is a logical connection between two tables that specifies fields that the tables have in common.
 Keys
Fields that are part of a table relationship are called keys. A key usually consists of one field, but may consist of more than one field. There are two kinds of keys:
 Primary key A table can have only one primary key. A primary key consists of one or more fields that uniquely identify each record that you store in the table. Often, there is a unique identification number, such as an ID number, a serial number, or a code, that serves as a primary key. For example, you might have a Customers table where each customer has a unique customer ID number. The customer ID field is the primary key of
the Customers table. When a primary key contains more than one field, it is usually composed of pre-existing fields that, taken together, provide unique values. For example, you might use a combination of last name, first name, and birth date as the primary key for a table about people
 Foreign key A table can also have one or more foreign keys. A foreign key contains values that correspond to values in the primary key of another table. For example, you might have an Orders table in which each order has a customer ID number that corresponds to a record in a Customers table. The customer ID field is a foreign key of the Orders table.
The correspondence of values between key fields forms the basis of a table relationship. You use a table relationship to combine data from related tables. For example, suppose that you have a Customers table and an Orders table. In your Customers table, each record is identified by the primary key field, ID.
To associate each order with a customer, you add a foreign key field to the Orders table that corresponds to the ID field of the Customers table, and then create a relationship between the two keys. When you add a record to the Orders table, you use a value for customer ID that comes from the Customers table. Whenever you want to view any information about an orders customer, you use the relationship to identify which data from the Customers table corresponds to which records in the Orders table.
1. A primary key, identified by the key icon next to the field name.
2. A foreign key — note the absence of the key icon.
Do not add a field if you expect that each unique entity represented in the table might require more than value for the field. Continuing the preceding example, if you want to start tracking
orders placed by your customers, you do not add a field to the table, because each customer will have more than one order. Instead, you create a new table to store orders, and then create a relationship between the two tables.
 Benefits of using relationships
Keeping data separated in related tables produces the following benefits:
 Consistency Because each item of data is recorded only once, in one table, there is less opportunity for ambiguity or inconsistency. For example, you store a customers name only once, in a table about customers, rather than storing it repeatedly (and potentially inconsistently) in a table that contains order data.
 Efficiency Recording data in only one place means you use less disk space. Moreover, smaller tables tend to provide data more quickly than larger tables. Finally, if you dont use separate tables for separate subjects, you will introduce null values (the absence of data) and redundancy into your tables, both of which can waste space and impede performance.
 Comprehensibility The design of a database is easier to understand if the subjects are properly separated into tables.
Plan your tables with relationships in mind. You can use the Lookup Wizard to create a foreign key field if the table that contains the corresponding primary key already exists. The Lookup Wizard creates the relationship for you.
 Introduction to queries
Using a query makes it easier to view, add, delete, or change data in your Access database. Some other reasons for using queries:
 Find specific quickly data by filtering on specific criteria (conditions)
 Calculate or summarize data
 Automate data management tasks, such as reviewing the most current data on a recurring basis.
Note: If you want to try out the queries in the examples, use an Access desktop database.
Queries help you find and work with your data
Create a select query
Create a parameter query
Create a totals query
Create a crosstab query
Create a make table query
Create an append query
Create an update query
Create a delete query
Queries help you find and work with your data
In a well-designed database, the data that you want to present through a form or report is usually located in multiple tables. A query can pull the information from various tables and assemble it for display in the form or report. A query can either be a request for data results from your database or for action on the data, or for both. A query can give you an answer to a simple question, perform calculations, combine data from different tables, add, change, or delete data from a database. Since queries are so versatile, there are many types of queries and you would create a type of query based on the task.
Major query types
Use
Select
To retrieve data from a table or make calculations.
Action
Add, change, or delete data. Each task has a specific type of action query. Action queries are not available in Access web apps.
 Create a select query
If you want to review data from only certain fields in a table, or review data from multiple tables simultaneously or maybe just see the data based on certain criteria, a select query type would be your choice.
 Review data from select fields
For example, if your database has a table with a lot of information about products and you want to review a list of products and their prices, here‘s how you‘d create a select query to return just the product names and the respective price:
1. Open the database and on the Create tab, click Query Design.
2. In the Show Table box, on the Tables tab, double-click the Products table and then close the dialog box.
3. In the Products table, let‘s say that you have Product Name and List Price fields. Double-click the Product Name and List Price to add these fields to the query design grid.
4. On the Design tab, click Run. The query runs, and displays a list of products and their prices.
 Review data from multiple related tables simultaneously
For example, if you have a database for a store that sells food items and you want to review orders for customers who live in a particular city. Say that the data about orders and data about customers are stored in two tables named Customers and Orders respectively. If each table has a Customer ID field, which forms the basis of a one-to-many relationship between the two tables. You can create a query that returns orders for customers in a particular city, for example, Las Vegas, by using the following procedure:
1. Open the database. On the Create tab, in the Query group, click Query Design.
2. In the Show Table dialog box, on the Tables tab, double-click Customers and Orders.
3. Close the Show Table dialog box. Note the line (called a join) that connects the ID field in the Customers table and the Customer ID field in the Orders table. This line shows the relationship between the two tables.
4. In the Customers table, double-click Company and City to add these fields to the query design grid.
5. In the query design grid, in the City column, clear the check box in the Show row.
6. In the Criteria row of the City column, type Las Vegas.
Clearing the Show check box prevents the query from displaying the city in its results, and typing Las Vegas in the Criteria row specifies that you want to see only records where the value of the City field is Las Vegas. In this case, the query returns only the customers that are located in Las Vegas. You don‘t need to display a field to use it with a criterion.
7. In the Orders table, double-click Order ID and Order Date to add these fields to the next two columns of the query design grid.
8. On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run. The query runs, and then displays a list of orders for customers in Las Vegas.
9. Press CTRL+S to save the query.
 Create a parameter query
If you frequently want to run variations of a particular query, consider using a parameter query. When you run a parameter query, the query prompts you for field values, and then uses the values that you supply to create criteria for your query.
Note: You cannot create a parameter query in an Access web app.
Continuing from the previous example where you learnt to create a select query that returns orders for customers located in Las Vegas, you can modify the select query to prompt you to specify the city each time that you run the query. To follow along, open the database that you created in the previous example:
1. In the Navigation Pane, right-click the query named Orders by City (that you created in the previous section), and then click Design View on the shortcut menu.
2. In the query design grid, in the Criteria row of the City column, delete Las Vegas, and then type [For what city?].
The string [For what city?] is your parameter prompt. The square brackets indicate that you want the query to ask for input, and the text (in this case, For what city?) is the question that the parameter prompt displays.
Note: Neither a period (.) nor an exclamation point (!) can be used as text in a parameter prompt.
3. Select the check box in the Show row of the City column, so that the query results will display the city.
4. On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run. The query prompts you to enter a value for City.
5. Type New York, and then press ENTER to see orders for customers in New York.
What if you dont know what values you can specify? You can use wildcard characters as part of the prompt:
6. On the Home tab, in the Views group, click View, and then click Design View.
7. In the query design grid, in the Criteria row of the City column, type Like [For what city?]"*".
In this parameter prompt, the Like keyword, the ampersand (), and the asterisk (*) enclosed in quotation marks allow the user to type a combination of characters, including wildcard characters, to return a variety of results. For example, if the user types *, the query returns all cities; if the user types L, the query returns all cities that start with the letter "L;" and if the user types *s*, the query returns all cities that contain the letter "s."
8. On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run, and at the query prompt, type New, and press ENTER. The query runs, and then displays orders for customers in New York.
 Specify parameter data types
You can also specify what type of data a parameter should accept. You can set the data type for any parameter, but it is especially important to set the data type for numeric, currency, or date/time data. When you specify the data type that a parameter should accept, users see a more helpful error message if they enter the wrong type of data, such as entering text when currency is expected. If a parameter is set to accept text data, any input is interpreted as text, and no error message is displayed.
To specify the data type for parameters in a query, use the following procedure:
1. With the query open in Design view, on the Design tab, in the Show/Hide group, click Parameters.
2. In the Query Parameters dialog box, in the Parameter column, type the prompt for each parameter for which you want to specify the data type. Make sure that each parameter matches the prompt that you use in the Criteria row of the query design grid.
3. In the Data Type column, select the data type for each parameter.
Create a totals query
The Total row in a datasheet is very useful, but for more complex questions, you use a totals query. A totals query is a select query that allows you to group and summarize data, like when you want to see total sales per product. In a totals query, you can use the Sum function (an aggregate function), to see total sales per product.
Note: You cannot use aggregate functions in an Access web app.
Use the following procedure to modify the Product Subtotals query that you created in the previous example so that it summarizes product subtotals by product.
1. On the Home tab, click View > Design View.
The Product Subtotals query opens in Design view.
2. On the Design tab, in the Show/Hide group, click Totals.
The Totals row is displayed in the query design grid.
Note: Although they have similar names, the Totals row in the design grid and the Total row in a datasheet are not the same:
 You can group by field values by using the Totals row in the design grid.
 You can add a datasheet Total row to the results of a totals query.
 When you use the Totals row in the design grid, you must choose an aggregate function for each field. If you do not want to perform a calculation on a field, you can group by the field.
 In the second column of the design grid, in the Total row, select Sum from the drop-down list.
 On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run. The query runs, and then displays a list of products with subtotals.
 Press CTRL+S to save the query. Leave the query open.
Make calculations based on your data You usually would not use tables to store calculated values, like subtotals, even if they are based on data in the same database, because calculated values can become outdated if the values that
they are based on changes. For example, you would not store someones age in a table, because every year you would have to update the value; instead, you store the persons date of birth, and then use a query to calculate the persons age.
For example if you have a database for some products you‘d like to sell. This database has a table called Orders Details that has information about the products in fields such as, price of each product and the quantities. You can calculate the subtotal by using a query that multiplies the quantity of each product by the unit price for that product, multiplies the quantity of each product by the unit price and discount for that product, and then subtracts the total discount from the total unit price. If you created the sample database in the previous example, open it and follow along:
1. On the Create tab, click Query Design.
2. In the Show Table dialog box, on the Tables tab, double-click Order Details.
3. Close the Show Table dialog box.
4. In the Order Details table, double-click Product ID to add this field to the first column of the query design grid.
5. In the second column of the grid, right-click the Field row, and then click Zoom on the shortcut menu.
6. In the Zoom box, type or paste the following: Subtotal: ([Quantity]*[Unit Price])-([Quantity]*[Unit Price]*[Discount])
7. Click OK.
8. On the Design tab, click Run. The query runs, and then displays a list of products and subtotals, per order.
9. Press CTRL+S to save the query, and then name the query Product Subtotals.
Display summarized or aggregate data
When you use tables to record transactions or store regularly occurring numeric data, it is useful to be able to review that data in aggregate, such as sums or averages. In Access, you can add a Totals row to a datasheet. Total row is a row at the bottom of the datasheet that can display a running total or other aggregate value.
1. Run the Product Subtotals query you created earlier, and leave the results open in Datasheet view.
2. On the Home tab, click Totals. A new row appears at the bottom of the datasheet, with the word Total in the first column.
3. Click the cell in the last row of the datasheet named Total.
4. Click the arrow to view the available aggregate functions. Because the column contains text data, there are only two choices: None and Count.
5. Select Count. The content of the cell changes from Total to a count of the column values.
6. Click the adjoining cell (the second column). Note that an arrow appears in the cell.
7. Click the arrow, and then click Sum. The field displays a sum of the column values.
8. Leave the query open in Datasheet view.
Create a crosstab query
Now suppose that you want to review product subtotals, but you also want to aggregate by month, so that each row shows subtotals for a product, and each column shows product subtotals for a month. To show subtotals for a product and to show product subtotals for a month, use a crosstab query.
Note: A crosstab query cannot be displayed in an Access web app.
You can modify the Product Subtotals query again so that the query returns rows of product subtotals and columns of monthly subtotals.
1. On the Home tab, in the Views group, click View, and then click Design View.
2. In the Query Setup group, click Show Table.
3. In the Show Table dialog box, double-click Orders, and then click Close.
4. On the Design tab, in the Query Type group, click Crosstab. In the design grid, the Show row is hidden, and the Crosstab row is displayed.
5. In the third column of the design grid, right-click the Field row, and then click Zoom on the shortcut menu. The Zoom box opens.
6. In the Zoom box, type or paste the following: Month: "Month "  DatePart("m", [Order Date])
7. Click OK.
8. In the Crosstab row, select the following values from the drop-down list: Row Heading for the first column, Value for the second column, and Column Heading for the third column.
9. On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run. The query runs, and then displays product subtotals, aggregated by month.
10. Press CTRL+S to save the query.
Create a make table query
You can use a make-table query to create a new table from data that is stored in other tables.
Note: A make-table query is not available in Access web apps.
For example, suppose that you want to send data for Chicago orders to a Chicago business partner who uses Access to prepare reports. Instead of sending all your order data, you want to restrict the data that you send to data specific to Chicago orders.
You can build a select query that contains Chicago order data, and then use the select query to create the new table by using the following procedure:
1. Open the example database from the previous example.
To run a make-table query, you may need to enable the database content.
Note: If you see a message beneath the Ribbon about enabling the database, click Enable content. If your database is already in a trusted location, you will not see the Message Bar.
2. On the Create tab, in the Query group, click Query Design.
3. In the Show Table dialog box, double-click Order Details and Orders and Close the Show Table dialog box.
4. In the Orders table, double-click Customer ID and Ship City to add these fields to the design grid.
5. In the Order Details table, double-click Order ID, Product ID, Quantity, Unit Price, and Discount to add these fields to the design grid.
6. In the Ship City column of the design grid, clear the box in the Show row. In the Criteria row, type Chicago (include the single quotation marks). Verify the query results before you use them to create the table.
7. On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run.
8. Press Ctrl + S to save the query.
9. In the Query Name box, type Chicago Orders Query, and then click OK.
10. On the Home tab, in the Views group, click View, and then click Design View.
11. On the Design tab, in the Query Type group, click Make Table.
12. In the Make Table dialog box, in the Table Name box, type Chicago Orders, and then click OK.
13. On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run.
14. In the confirmation dialog box, click Yes, and see the new table displayed in the Navigation Pane.
Note: If there is already a table with the same name that you specified, Access deletes that table before running the query.
Create an append query
You can use an append query to retrieve data from one or more tables and add that data to another table.
Note: Append query is not available in Access web apps.
For example, suppose that you created a table to share with a Chicago business associate, but you realize that the associate also works with clients in the Milwaukee area. You want to add rows that contain Milwaukee area data to the table before you share the table with your associate. You can add Milwaukee area data to the Chicago Orders table by using the following procedure:
1. Open the query named "Chicago Orders Query" you created earlier in Design view.
2. On the Design tab, in the Query Type group, click Append. The Append dialog box opens.
3. In the Append dialog box, click the arrow in the Table Name box, select Chicago Orders from the drop-down list, and then click OK.
4. In the design grid, in the Criteria row of the Ship City column, delete Chicago, and then type Milwaukee.
5. In the Append To row, select the appropriate field for each column.
In this example, the Append To row values should match the Field row values, but that is not required for append queries to work.
6. On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run.
Note: While running a query that returns a large amount of data you might get an error message indicating that you will not be able to undo the query. Try increasing the limit on the memory segment to 3MB to allow the query to go through.
 Create an update query
You can use an update query to change the data in your tables, and you can use an update query to enter criteria to specify which rows should be updated. An update query provides you an opportunity to review the updated data before you perform the update.
Important: An action query cannot be undone. You should consider making a backup of any tables that you will update by using an update query. An update query is not available in Access web apps.
In the previous example, you appended rows to the Chicago Orders table. In the Chicago Orders table, the Product ID field shows the numeric Product ID. To make the data more useful in reports, you can replace the product IDs with product names, use the following procedure:
1. Open the Chicago Orders table in Design view.
2. In the Product ID row, change the Data Type from Number to Text.
3. Save and close the Chicago Orders table.
4. On the Create tab, in the Query group, click Query Design.
5. In the Show Table dialog box, double-click Chicago Orders and Products, and close the Show Table dialog box.
6. On the Design tab, in the Query Type group, click Update.
7. In the design grid, the Sort and Show rows disappear, and the Update To row appears.
8. In the Chicago Orders table, double-click Product ID to add this field to the design grid.
9. In the design grid, in the Update To row of the Product ID column, type or paste the following: [Products].[Product Name]
Tip: You can use an update query to delete field values by using an empty string ("") or NULL in the Update To row.
10. In the Criteria row, type or paste the following: [Product ID] Like ([Products].[ID])
11. You can review which values will be changed by an update query by viewing the query in Datasheet view.
12. On the Design tab, click View > Datasheet View. The query returns a list of Product IDs that will be updated.
13. On the Design tab, click Run.
When you open the Chicago Orders table, you will see that the numeric values in the Product ID field have been replaced by the product names from the Products table.
 Create a delete query
You can use a delete query to delete data from your tables, and you can use a delete query to enter criteria to specify which rows should be deleted. A delete query provides you an opportunity to review the rows that will be deleted before you perform the deletion.
Note: A delete query option is not available in Access web apps.
For example, say that while you were preparing to send the Chicago Orders table from the previous example, to your Chicago business associate, you notice that some of the rows contain a number of empty fields. You decided to remove these rows before you send the table. You could just open the table and delete the rows manually, but if you have many rows to delete and you have clear criteria for which rows should be deleted, you might find it helpful to use a delete query.
You can use a query to delete rows in the Chicago Orders table that do not have a value for Order ID by using the following procedure:
1. On the Create tab, click Query Design.
2. In the Show Table box, double-click Chicago Orders and close the Show Table box.
3. On the Design tab, in the Query Type group, click Delete. In the design grid, the Sort and Show rows disappear, and the Delete row appears.
4. In the Chicago Orders table, double-click Order ID to add it to the grid.
5. In the design grid, in the Criteria row of the Order ID column, type Is Null.
6. On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run.
Create a form in Access
Forms in Access are like display cases in stores that make it easier to view or get the items that you want. Since forms are objects through which you or other users can add, edit, or display the data stored in your Access desktop database, the design of your form is an important aspect. If your Access desktop database is going to be used by multiple users, well-designed forms are essential for efficiency and data entry accuracy.
There are several ways of creating a form in an Access desktop database and this article points you to some of the common ways.
Note: The information in this article does not apply to Access web databases or Access web apps.
 What do you want to do?
Create a form from an existing table or query in Access
Create a blank form in Access
Create a split form in Access
Create a form that displays multiple records in Access
Create a form that contains a subform in Access
Create a Navigation form in Access
Additional information
 Create a form from an existing table or query in Access
To create a form from a table or query in your database, in the Navigation Pane, click the table or query that contains the data for your form, and on the Create tab, click Form.
Access creates a form and displays it in Layout view. You can make design changes like adjusting the size of the text boxes to fit the data, if necessary. For more information, see the article on using the form tool.
 Create a blank form in Access
1. To create a form with no controls or preformatted elements: On the Create tab, click Blank Form. Access opens a blank form in Layout view, and displays the Field List pane.
2. In the Field List pane, click the plus sign (+) next to the table or tables that contain the fields that you want to see on the form.
3. To add a field to the form, double-click it or drag it onto the form. To add several fields at once, hold down CTRL and click several fields, and then drag them onto the form at the same time.
Note: The order of the tables in the Field List pane can change, depending on which part of the form is currently selected. If you are not able to add a field to the form, try selecting a different part of the form and then try adding the field again.
4. Use the tools in the Controls group on the Form Layout Tools tab to add a logo, title, page numbers, or the date and time to the form.
5. If you want to add a wider variety of controls to the form, click Design and use the tools in the Controls group.
 Create a split form in Access
A split form gives you two views of the data at the same time — a Form view and a Datasheet view. Working with split forms gives you the benefits of both types of forms in a single form. For example, you can use the datasheet portion of the form to quickly locate a record, and then use the form portion to view or edit the record. The two views are connected to the same data source and are synchronized with each other at all times.
To create a new split form by using the Split Form tool, in the Navigation Pane, click the table or query that contains the data, and then on the Create tab, click More Forms, and then click Split Form.
Access creates the form and you can make design changes to the form. For example, you can adjust the size of the text boxes to fit the data, if necessary. For more information on working with a split form, see the article on creating a split form.
 Create a form that displays multiple records in Access
A multiple item form, also known as a continuous form, and is useful if you want a form that displays multiple records but is more customizable than a datasheet, you can use the Multiple Items tool.
1. In the Navigation Pane, click the table or query that contains the data you want to see on your form.
2. On the Create tab and click More Forms > Multiple Items.
Access creates the form and displays it in Layout view. In Layout view, you can make design changes to the form while it is displaying data. For example, you can adjust the size of the text boxes to fit the data. For more details, see Create a form by using the Multiple Items tool.
 Create a form that contains a subform in Access
When you are working with related data that is stored in separate tables, you often need to view data from multiple tables or queries on the same form and subforms are a convenient way to do this. Since there are several ways of adding a subform depending on your needs, for more information, see the article Create a form that contains a subform (a one-to-many form).
 Create a Navigation form in Access
A navigation form is simply a form that contains a Navigation Control. Navigation forms are a great addition to any database, but creating a navigation form is particularly important if you plan to publish a database to the Web, because the Access Navigation Pane does not display in a browser.
1. Open the database to which you want to add a navigation form.
2. On the Create tab, in the Forms group, click Navigation, and then select the style of navigation form that you want.
Access creates the form, adds the Navigation Control to it, and displays the form in Layout view. For more information, see Create a navigation form.
 Additional information
There are several options that you can use to customize your forms, see if some the following fit your needs:
 Introduction to reports in Access
Reports offer a way to view, format, and summarize the information in your Microsoft Access database. For example, you can create a simple report of phone numbers for all your contacts, or a summary report on the total sales across different regions and time periods.
From this article, you‘ll get an overview of reports in Access. You‘ll also learn the basics of creating a report, and using options like sorting, grouping, and summarizing the data, and how to preview and print the report.

 Overview of reports in Access
 What can you do with a report?
A report is a database object that comes in handy when you want to present the information in your database for any of the following uses:
 Display or distribute a summary of data.
 Archive snapshots of the data.
 Provide details about individual records.
 Create labels.
 Parts of a report While it is possible to create “unbound” reports that do not display data, but for the purposes of this article, we‘ll assume that a report is bound to a data source such as a table or query. The design of a report is divided into sections that you can view in the Design view. Understanding how each section works can helps you create better reports.
For example, the section in which you choose to place a calculated control determines how Access calculates the results. The following list is a summary of the section types and their uses:
 Create a report in Access
You can create reports for you Access desktop database by following the steps below:
Step 1: Choose a record source
The record source of a report can be a table, a named query, or an embedded query. The record source must contain all of the rows and columns of data you want display on the report.
 If the data is from an existing table or query, select the table or query in the Navigation Pane, and then continue to Step 2.
 If the record source does not yet exist, do one of the following:
o Continue to Step 2 and use the Blank Report tool,
Or
o Create the table(s) or query that contains the required data. Select the query or table in the Navigation Pane, and then continue to Step 2.
Step 2: Choose a report tool
The report tools are located on the Create tab of the ribbon, in the Reports group. The following table describes the options:
Tool
Description
Report
Creates a simple, tabular report containing all of the fields in the record source you selected in the Navigation Pane.
Report Design
Opens a blank report in Design view, to which you can add the required fields and controls.
Blank Report
Opens a blank report in Layout view, and displays the Field List from where you can add fields to the report
Report Wizard
Displays a multiple-step wizard that lets you specify fields, grouping/sorting levels, and layout options.
Labels
Displays a wizard that lets you select standard or custom label sizes, as well as which fields you want to display, and how you want them sorted.
Step 3: Create the report
1. Click the button for the tool you want to use. If a wizard appears, follow the steps in the wizard and click Finish on the last page. Access displays the report in Layout view.
2. Format the report to achieve the looks that you want:
o Resize fields and labels by selecting them and then dragging the edges until they are the size you want. o Move a field by selecting it (and its label, if present), and then dragging it to the new location.
o Right-click a field and use the commands on the shortcut menu to merge or split cells, delete or select fields, and perform other formatting tasks.
In addition, you can use the features described in the following sections to make your report more attractive and readable.
 Add grouping, sorting, or totals
The fastest way to add grouping, sorting, or totals to a desktop database report is to right-click the field to which you want to apply the group, sort, or total, and then click the desired command on the shortcut menu.
You can also add grouping, sorting, or totals by using the Group, Sort, and Total pane while the report is open in Layout view or Design view:
1. If the Group, Sort, and Total pane is not already open, on the Design tab, in the Grouping and Totals group, click Group  Sort.
2. Click Add a group or Add a sort, and then select the field on which you want to group or sort.
3. Click More on a grouping or sorting line to set more options and to add totals.
 Highlight data with conditional formatting
Access includes tools for highlighting data on a report. You can add conditional formatting rules for each control or group of controls, and in client reports, you can also add data bars to compare data.
To add conditional formatting to controls:
1. Right-click the report in the Navigation Pane and click Layout View.
2. Select the required controls and on the Format tab, in the Control Formatting group, click Conditional Formatting.
Tip: To select multiple controls, hold down the CTRL key and click the controls.
3. In the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box, click New Rule.
4. In the New Formatting Rule dialog box, select a value under Select a rule type:
o To create a rule that is evaluated for each record individually, select Check values in the current record or use an expression.
o To create a rule that compares records to each other by using data bars, click Compare to other records.
1. Under Edit the rule description, specify the rule for when the formatting would be applied as well as what formatting should be applied, and then click OK.
2. To create an additional rule for the same control or set of controls, repeat this procedure from step 4.
 Customizing color and fonts
Try an App Theme options to customize the color and fonts.
1. Open a report in Layout view by right-clicking it in the Navigation Pane and then clicking Layout View.
2. From the Report Layout Tools options, on the Design tab, click Themes and point the cursor over the various themes in the gallery to preview the effects. Click on a theme to select it, and then save your report.
3. Use the Colors or Fonts galleries to set colors or fonts independently.
 Add a logo or background image
You can add a logo or background image to a report and If you update the image, the update is automatically made wherever the image is used in the database.
To add or remove an image:
1. In the Navigation Pane, right-click the report and click Layout View.
2. In the report, click the position where you want to add the image and on the Design tab, in the Header/Footer group, click Logo.
3. Navigate to the image, and click Open. Access adds the image to the report.
4. To remove the image, right-click the image and click Delete from the shortcut menu.
To add a background image:
1. In the Navigation Pane, right-click the report and click Layout View.
2. On the Format tab, in the Background group, click Background Image.
3. Select an image from the Image Gallery list or click Browse, select an image, and then click OK.
 Preview and print a report
 Preview a report
1. Right-click the report in the Navigation Pane and click Print Preview. You can use the commands on the Print Preview tab to do any of the following:
o Print the report
o Adjust page size or layout
o Zoom in or out, or view multiple pages at a time
o Refresh the data on the report
o Export the report to another file format.
2. Click Close Print Preview.
 Print a report
To print a report without previewing it:
 Right-click the report in the Navigation Pane and click Print. The report is sent to your default printer.
Note: If you select the report in the Navigation Pane and select Print from the File tab, you can select additional printing options such as number of pages and copies and specify a printer.
o To open a dialog box where you can select a printer, specify the number of copies, and so on, click Print.
 Protect your data with backup and restore processes
You will need a backup copy of your Access desktop database to either restore the entire database if there is a system failure or to restore an object when the Undo command isnt enough to fix a mistake.
If a backup copy of your database seems a wasted use of storage space, consider the time that you might save by avoiding data and design loss. Creating backups on a regular basis is especially important when you have several users updating a database. Without a backup copy, you cannot restore corrupted or missing objects or any changes to the database design.
Note: This article doesn‘t apply to Access web apps.

 Plan regular backups
Some changes or mistakes cannot be reversed, so you dont want to wait for data loss to occur before you realize that you should have created a backup copy of the database. For example,
when you use an action query to delete records or to change data, any values that were updated by the query cannot be restored by using Undo.
Tip: Consider making a backup before you run any action query, especially if the query will change or delete data.
If your database has several users, before you perform a backup make sure that all users close their databases so that all changes to the data are saved.
Here are some guidelines to help you decide how often to back up your database:
 If the database is an archive, or if it is used only for reference and rarely changes, it is sufficient to create backups only when the design or data is changed.
 If the database is active and the data frequently changes, create a schedule to regularly backup the database.
 If the database has multiple users, create a backup copy of the database after a design change.
Note: For data in linked tables create backups by using any available backup features in the program that contains the linked tables. If the database that contains the linked tables is an Access database, use the procedure in the section Back up a split database.
 Back up a database
When you back up a database, Access saves and closes objects that are open in Design view and saves a copy of the database file by using a name and location that you specify.
Note: Access reopens objects as specified by the value of the object Default View property.
Open the database for which you want to create a backup copy and do the following:
1. Click File, and then click Save As.
2. Under File Types, click Save Database As.
3. Under Advanced, click Back Up Database, and then click Save As.
4. In the Save As dialog box, in the File name box, review the name for your database backup.
You can change the name if you want, but the default name captures both the name of the original database file and the date that you make the backup.
Tip: When you restore data or objects from a backup, you usually want to know which database the backup came from and when the backup was created, so it‘s good practice to use the default file name.
5. Select the file type you want the backup database to be saved as from the Save as type list, and then click Save.
 Back up a split database
A split database typically consists of two database files: a back-end database, which contains only data in tables, and a front-end database, which contains links to the tables in the back-end database, queries, forms, reports, and other database objects. All the data is stored in the back-end database. All the user interface objects, such as queries, forms, and reports, are kept in the front-end database.
Backing up the front-end and back-end databases independent of one another as you must do with a split database can be time consuming. Because the back-end database contains the data, it is more important to make regular backups of the back-end database.
Make a backup of the front-end database when you change its design. Individual users of the front-end database can make arbitrary design changes, so consider requiring the users to make their own backup copies of the front-end database.
 Back up a back-end database
Notify users before you start the backup process because running the backup process requires exclusive access to the database file, and users might be unable to use the back-end database while the backup process is running.
1. To open only the back-end database, start Access.
2. Click Open Other Files > Computer > Browse, and then select the back-end database file that you want to back up.
3. Click the arrow next to Open, and then click Open Exclusive.
4. Click File, and then click Save As.
5. Under File Types, click Save Database As.
6. Under Advanced, click Back Up Database, and then click Save As.
7. In the Save As dialog box, in the File name box, review the name for your database backup.
You can change the name if you want, but the default name captures both the name of the original database file and the date that you make the backup.
Tip: When you restore data or objects from a backup, you usually want to know which database the backup came from and when the backup was created, so it‘s good practice to use the default file name.
8. In the Save As dialog box, select a location in which to save the backup copy of your back-end database, and then click Save.
 Back up a front-end database
To back up a front-end database after a design change, leave the database open immediately after you change its design, and then follow the steps in the section back up a database, starting at step 2.
 Restore a database
Note: You can only restore a database if you have a backup copy of the database.
A backup is considered a "known good copy" of a database file—a copy of which you are confident of its data integrity and design. You should use the Back Up Database command in Access to make backups, but you can use any known good copy to restore a database. For example, you can restore a database from a copy that is stored on a USB external backup device.
When you restore a whole database, you replace a database file that is damaged, has data problems, or is missing completely, with a backup copy of the database.
1. Open File Explorer and browse to the known good copy of the database.
2. Copy the known good copy to the location where the damaged or missing database should be replaced.
If you are prompted to replace an existing file, do so.
Restore objects in a database
If you have to restore one or more objects in a database, import the objects from the backup copy of the database into the database that contains (or is missing) the object that you want restored.
Important: If other databases or programs have links to objects in the database that you are restoring, it is critical that you restore the database to the correct location. If you do not, links to the database objects will not work and will have to be updated.
1. Open the database to which you want to restore an object.
2. To restore a missing object, skip to step 3. To replace an object that contains bad or missing data or if the object has stopped working correctly, do the following:
a. If you want to preserve the current object, to compare it with the restored version after you restore, rename the object before you restore it. For example, if you want to restore a damaged form named Checkout, you can rename the damaged form Checkout bad.
b. Delete the object that you want to replace.
Note: Always be careful when you delete database objects as they could be linked to other objects in the database.
3. Click External Data, and in the Import  Link group, click Access.
4. In the Get External Data-Access Database dialog box, click Browse to locate the backup database, and then click Open.
5. Select Import tables, queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules into the current database, and then click OK.
6. In the Import Objects dialog box, click the tab that corresponds to the type of object that you want to restore. For example, if you want to restore a table, click the Tables tab.
7. Click the object to select it.
8. If you want to restore more objects, repeat steps 6 and 7 until you have selected all of the objects that you want to restore.
9. To review the import options before importing the objects, in the Import Objects dialog box, click the Options button.
10. After you select the objects and import setting options, click OK to restore the objects.
To automate creating backups, consider using a product that performs automated backups of a file system, such as file server backup software or a USB external backup device.
